RelatedCan a Muslim visit the Tirupati Balaji Temple?,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-Muslim-visit-the-Tirupati-Balaji-Temple,,Yes a Muslim or for that matter anyone belonging to any religion can visit Tirupati Balaji temple. One is required to sign a statement of belief in Lord Balaji. That is the legal entry. Generally one is not stopped if one does not wear any dress showing that he/she belongs to any religion other than Hinduism. That is illegal and I do not suggest it even though it is easy. Now how about religious sanction? It is time to talk of the story of Bibi Nancharamma. A daughter of Malik Kafar ( aladdin Khilji‚Äôs general) accompanied her father during his conquest of South India and became a devotee of Lord Venkateswara. Even after going back to Delhi she could not be diverted. Finally she reached Tirumala and Balaji took her as his consort. So there is religious sanction for any devotee having Lord‚Äôs Darsan. It may be pointed out that Muslims throng to the temple and worship Lord Venkateswara in Kadapa on Telugu new year‚Äôs day. Kadapa is considered the threshold of Lord Venkateswara‚Äôs residence.

What happens in a hospital is treatment and in police station is punishment for the accused. In a burial ground dead bodies are burnt but in play grounds or parks people play or enjoy the ambience. In this way we can give many examples. These activities cannot be exchanged or replaced as it would look absurd undesirable and spoils the very purpose of that place. Just imagine if dead bodies are burnt or if somebody is hanged in a public relaxing park can anyone go there for that purpose? In 1800 there was psychic king and as such his mind was not in his control this king wanted to give punishment for criminals in a different way so as to stop further crimes in his kingdom hence he killed 12 criminals as punishment and hanged their dead bodies in the entrance of Thirumala temple and took it granted for himself that people will now be scared to commit offences as the devotees would think that the Lord will further punish them in their next lives.

[1] Kaaba was a holy site for Arabian Pagans and it hosted the idols of the pagan deities. The chief deity was Hubal - the moon god.After the invasion of Mecca Mohammad took over Kaaba and destroyed the idols present in the Kaaba. Since then it became a holy site for Muslims.Kaaba and Shivalinga rumour : The credit for linking Shivalinga with Arabs goes to Savarkar. In his book ‚ÄúSix glorious epochs of Indian history ‚Äú In paragraph 650 he claims Arabians worshipped Shivalinga. [2]Let‚Äôs not blame Savarkar entirely for the rumour. The rumour has a long history. The Islamic rumour about Somnath Lingam : In fact early Muslims thought that the Idol of Somnath Linga was the statue of Arabian pagan goddess. Romilla Thapar wrote : [3] ‚ÄúA major poet of the eastern Islamic world Farrukhi Sistani who claims that he accompanied Mahmud to Somanatha provides a fascinating explanation for the breaking of the idol. This explanation has been largely dismissed by modern historians as too fanciful but it has a significance for the assessment of iconoclasm. According to him the idol was not of a Hindu deity but of a pre-Islamic Arabian goddess. He tells us that the name Somnat (as it was often written in Persian) is actually Su-manat the place of Manat. We know from the Qur'an that Lat Uzza and Manat were the three pre-Islamic goddesses widely worshipped and the destruction of their shrines and images it was said had been ordered by the Prophet Mohammad. Al-lat Manat and Al-Uzza :Two were destroyed but Manat was believed to have been secreted away to Gujarat and installed in a place of worship. According to some descriptions Manat was an aniconic block of black stone so the form could be similar to a lingam. This story hovers over many of the Turko-Persian accounts some taking it seriously others being less emphatic and insisting instead that the icon was of a Hindu deity. THE identification of the Somanatha idol with that of Manat has little historical credibility. There is no evidence to suggest that the temple housed an image of Manat. Nevertheless the story is significant to the reconstruction of the aftermath of the event since it is closely tied to the kind of legitimation which was being projected for Mahmud.‚ÄùIt is interesting to note that early Muslims believed the rumour that Somnath Idol was that of Al-manat‚Äôs idol. While today‚Äôs far right Hindus believe Kaaba was a Shiva temple which hosted a Linga.Footnotes[1] Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia - Wikipedia[2] https://savarkar.org/en/pdfs/6_Glorious_Epochs_of_Indian_History.pdf[3] txt_thapar_somnath

This presents photographs (listed below) that show the Vedic influence found in such buildings as the Taj Mahal Red Fort and other structures in India. In fact as recently as 1910 the Encyclopedia Brittanica also said that it was a pre-existing building before Shah Jahan. It is because of the manipulation of history by invaders that the true greatness of India and Vedic culture has been stifled or hidden. And it is time that people everywhere realize how numerous lies and false propaganda have been passed around as if it were the truth in regard to India and its past as well as its art archeology and the wonder of its culture. Descriptions of the Photographs of the Taj MahalPhoto # 1: ‚ÄúAn aerial view of the Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya ancient Hindu temple complex in Agra. For the last 300 years the world has been fooled to believe that this stupendous edifice was built by the 5th generation Mogul emperor Shahjahan to commemorate one of his dead wives‚ÄìMumtaz. The two flanking buildings although identical only the one in the rear is known as a mosque. The Taj Mahal has seven stories. Five of them lie sealed and barred concealing rich evidence. The marble building in the centre is flanked by two symmetrical ones. The one in the foreground is the eastern one. The one in the background is being represented as a mosque because it is to the west. They should not have been identical if only one was to be a mosque. In the courtyard at the foot of the eastern building is inlaid a full scale replica of the trident pinnacle [found at the top of the dome]. The tiny tower at the left near the western building encloses a huge octagonal multi-storied well.‚Äù[1]Photo # 2: ‚ÄúThis is the massive octagonal well with palatial apartments along its seven stories. A royal staircase descends right down to the water level indicated by the tiny white patch showing the sun‚Äôs reflection. This was the traditional treasury well of the Hindu temple palace. Treasure chests used to be stacked in the lower stories. Accountants cashiers and treasurers sat in the upper stories. Cheques called handies used to be issued from here. On being besieged if the building had to be surrendered to the enemy the treasure used to be pushed into the water for salvage later after recapture. For real research water should be pumped out of this well to reveal the evidence that lies at the bottom. This well is inside a tower near the so-called mosque to the west of the marble Taj. Had the Taj been a mausoleum this octagonal multistoried well would have been superfluous.‚Äù [1] [2]Photo # 3: ‚ÄúA frontal view of the Taj Mahal alias Tejo Mahalaya in Agra. It is octagonal because the Hindus believe in 10 directions. The pinnacle pointing to the heaven and the foundation to the nether world plus the eight surface directions make the 10 directions. Divinity and royalty are believed to hold sway in all those 10 directions. Hence in Hindu tradition buildings connected with royalty and divinity must have some octagonal features or the buildings themselves should be octagonal. The two flanking cupolas (two others to the rear are not seen in this photo) are also identical. The towers at the four plinth corners served as watch towers during the day and to hold lights at night. Hindu wedding altars and Satyanarayan worship altars invariably have such towers at corners. [Many other Hindu temples such as those at Khajurao also can be found to have four towers or temples one at each corner of the temple foundation.] The lotus flower cap on the head of the dome is a Hindu feature. Muslim domes are bald. This marble edifice has four stories. Inside the dome is an 83 ft. high hall. The Taj has a double dome. The dome one sees from inside ends like an inverted pan on the terrace. The dome seen from outside is a cover on the inner dome. Therefore in between them is an 83 ft. hall. This may be considered as one storey. Underneath may be seen the first storey arches and the ground floor rooms. In the basement visitors are shown one room. All these constitute the four storeys in the marble edifice. Below the marble structure are two stories in red stone reaching down to the river level. The 7th storey must be below the river level because every ancient Hindu historic building did have a basement. Thus the Taj is a seven-storied structure.‚Äù [1] [2]Photo # 4: ‚ÄúThe dome of the Taj Mahal bearing a trident pinnacle made of a non-rusting eight-metal Hindu alloy. The pinnacle served as a lightning deflector too. This pinnacle has been blindly assumed by many to be an Islamic crescent and star or a lightning conductor installed by the British. This is a measure of the careless manner in which Indian history has been studied till now. Visually identifiable things like this pinnacle too have been misinterpreted with impunity. The flower top of the dome below the pinnacle is an unmistakable Hindu sign. A full scale figure of this pinnacle is inlaid in the eastern courtyard.‚Äù[1] [2]Photo # 5: ‚ÄúA close up of the upper portion of the pinnacle of the Taj Mahal photographed from the parapet beneath the dome. The Hindu horizontal crescent and the coconut top together look like a trident from the garden level. Islamic crescents are always oblique. Moreover they are almost always complete circles leaving a little opening for a star. This Hindu pinnacle had all these centuries been misinterpreted as an Islamic crescent and star or a lightning conductor installed by the British. The word ‚ÄúAllah‚Äù etched here by Shahjahan is absent in the courtyard replica. The coconut the bent mango leaves under it and the supporting Kalash (water pot) are exclusive Hindu motifs.‚Äù[1]Photo # 6: ‚ÄúThe full scale figure of the pinnacle on the dome has been inlaid on the red stone courtyard of the Taj Mahal. One may see it to the east at the foot of the riverside arch of the flanking building wrongly dubbed as Jamiat Khana (community hall) by Muslim usurpers. Such floor sketches in courtyards are a common Hindu trait. In Fatehpur Sikri it is the backgammon board which is sketched on a central courtyard. The coconut top and the bent mango leaves underneath resting on a kalash (i.e. a water pot) is a sacred Hindu motif. Hindu shrines in the Himalayan foothills have identical pinnacles [especially noticed at Kedarnath a prominent Shiva temple]. The eastern location of the sketch is also typically Hindu. The length measures almost 32 ft.‚Äù [1]Photo # 7: ‚ÄúThe apex of the lofty entrance arch on all four sides of the Taj Mahal bears this red lotus and white trident‚Äìindicating that the building originated as a Hindu temple. The Koranic lettering forming the middle strip was grafted after Shahjahan seized the building from Jaipur state‚Äôs Hindu ruler.‚Äù [1]Photo # 8: ‚ÄúThis is a riverside view of the Taj Mahal. The four storied marble structure above has under it these two stories reaching down to the river level. The 22 rooms shown in other photos are behind that line of arches seen in the middle. Each arch is flanked by Hindu lotus discs in white marble. Just above the ground level is the plinth. In the left corner of the plinth is a doorway indicating inside the plinth are many rooms sealed by Shahjahan. One could step out to the river bank from the door at the left. The 7th storey is surmised to be under the plinth below the ground because every ancient Hindu mansion had a basement. Excavation to reach the basement chamber should start under this door.‚Äù [1]Photo # 9: ‚ÄúMost people content to see Mumtaz‚Äôs grave inside the Taj fail to go to the rear riverside. This is the riverside view. From here one may notice that the four-storied marble structure on top has below it two more stories in red stone. Note the window aperture in the arch at the left. That indicates that there are rooms inside. Inside the row of arches in the upper part of the wall are 22 rooms. In addition to the four stories in marble this one shows red stone arches in the 5th storey. The 6th storey lies in the plinth in the lower portion of the photo. In another photo a doorway would be seen in the left corner of the plinth indicating the presence of apartments inside from where one could emerge on the river for a bath.‚Äù [1]Photo # 10: ‚ÄúThese corridors at the approach of the Taj Mahal are typically Hindu. They may be seen in any ancient Hindu capital. Note the two octagonal tower cupolas at the right and left top. Only Hindus have special names for the eight directions and celestial guards assigned to each. Any octagonal feature in historic buildings should convince the visitor of their Hindu origin. Guards palanquin bearers and other attendants resided in hundreds of rooms along numerous such corridors when the Taj Mahal was a Hindu temple palace. Thus the Taj was more magnificent and majestic before it was reduced to a sombre Islamic cemetery.‚Äù [1] [2]Photo # 11: ‚ÄúThis Naqqar Khana alias Music House in the Taj Mahal garden is an incongruity if the Taj Mahal were an Islamic tomb. Close by on the right is the building which Muslims claim to be a mosque. The proximity of a mosque to the Music House is incongruous with Muslim tradition. In India Muslims have a tradition of pelting stones on Hindu music processions passing over a mosque. Moreover a mausoleum needs silence. A dead person‚Äôs repose is never to be disturbed. Who would then provide a band house for a dead Mumtaz? Contrarily Hindu temples and palaces have a music house because morning and evening Hindu chores begin to the sweet strains of sacred music.‚Äù [1]Photo # 12: ‚ÄúSuch are the rooms on the 1st floor of the marble structure of the Taj Mahal. The two staircases leading to this upper floor are kept locked and barred since Shahjahan‚Äôs time. The floor and the marble walls of such upper floor rooms can be seen in the picture to have been stripped of its marble panels. Shahjahan used that uprooted marble from the upper floor for constructing graves and engraving the Koran because he did not know wherefrom to procure marble matching the splendour of the rest of the Taj Mahal. He was also so stingy as not to want to spend much even on converting a robbed Hindu temple into an Islamic mausoleum.‚Äù [1] [2]Photo # 13: ‚ÄúSuch are the magnificent marble-paved shining cool white bright rooms of the Taj Mahal temple palace‚Äôs marble ground floor. Even the lower third portion of the walls is covered with magnificent marble mosaic. The doorway at the left looks suspiciously closed with a stone slab. One can perambulate through these rooms around the central octagonal sanctorum now occupied by Mumtaz‚Äôs fake grave. The aperture seen through of the central door enabled perambulating devotees to keep their eyes fixed on the Shiva Linga in the central chamber. Hindu Shiva Lingas are consecrated in two chambers one above the other. Therefore Shahjahan had to raise two graves in the name of Mumtaz‚Äìone in the marble basement and the other on the ground floor to desecrate and hide both the Shiva emblems from public view. [The famous Shiva temple in Ujjain also has an underground chamber for one of its Shiva-lingams.]‚Äù [1] [2]Photo # 14: ‚ÄúThis is the Dhatura flower essential for Hindu Shiva worship. The flower is depicted in the shape of the sacred esoteric Hindu incantation ‚ÄòOM.‚Äô Embossed designs of this blooming ‚ÄòOM‚Äô are drawn over the exterior of the octagonal central sanctorum of Shiva where now a fake grave in Mumtaz‚Äôs has been planted. While perambulating around the central chamber one may see such ‚ÄòOM‚Äô designs.‚Äù [1]Photo # 15: ‚ÄúThis staircase and another symmetrical one at the other end lead down to the storey beneath the marble platform. Visitors may go to the back of the marble plinth at the eastern or western end and descend down the staircase because it is open to the sky. But at the foot the archaeology department has set up an iron door which it keeps locked. Yet one may peep inside from the iron gate in the upper part of the door. Shahjahan had sealed even these two staircases. It was the British who opened them. But from Shahjahan‚Äôs time the stories below and above the marble ground floor have been barred to visitors. We are still following Mogul dictates though long free from Mogul rule.‚Äù [1]Photo # 16: ‚ÄúOn the inner flank of the 22 locked rooms (in the secret storey in red stone below the marble platform) is this corridor about 12 ft. broad and 300 ft. long. Note the scallop design at the base of the plinth supporting the arches. This is the Hindu decoration which enables one to identify even a bare plinth.‚Äù [1]Photo # 17: ‚ÄúOne of the 22 rooms in the secret storey underneath the marble plinth of the Taj Mahal. Many such features of the Taj remain unknown to the public so long as they see it only as a tomb. If the public knew how much it is missing in the Taj Mahal it will insist that the government unseal its many stories. Two doorways at either end of this corridor in the right side wall leading to inner apartments have been sealed by Shahjahan. If those doorways are opened important evidence concealed inside by Shahjahan may come to light.‚Äù [1]Photo # 18: ‚ÄúA corner of one of the 22 rooms in the secret storey immediately below the marble platform of the Taj Mahal. Note the strips of Hindu paint on the wall. The ventilator at the left meant for air and light from the riverside has been crudely walled up by Shahjahan. He did not bother even to plaster them. Had Shahjahan built the Taj as a mausoleum what was the purpose of the 22 rooms? And why are they kept locked and hidden from the public?‚Äù [1]Photo # 19: ‚ÄúOne of the 22 locked rooms in the secret storey beneath the marble platform of the Taj Mahal. Strips of ancient Hindu paint are seen on the wall flanking the doorway. The niches above had paintings of Hindu idols obviously rubbed off by Muslim desecraters. The rooms may be seen door within door in a row. If the public knew that the Taj Mahal is a structure hiding hundreds of rooms they would insist on seeing the whole of it. At present they only peep into the grave chamber and walk away.‚Äù [1]Photo # 20: ‚ÄúThis esoteric Hindu design is painted on the ceiling of some of the 22 locked rooms in the secret storey below the marble platform of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Had Shahjahan built the Taj Mahal he would not have kept such elaborately painted rooms sealed and barred to the public. Even now one can enter these rooms only if one can influence the archaeology department to remove the locks.‚Äù [1]Photo # 21: ‚ÄúA huge ventilator of one of the 22 rooms in a secret storey of the Taj is seen here crudely sealed with unplastered bricks by Shahjahan. History has been so perverted and inverted that alien Muslims like Shahjahan who spoiled damaged desecrated and destroyed historic Hindu buildings are being falsely paraded as great builders.‚Äù [1] [3]Photo # 22: ‚ÄúOne of the 22 riverside rooms in a secret storey of the Taj Mahal unknown to the public. Shahjahan far from building the shining marble Taj wantonly disfigured it. Here he has crudely walled up a doorway. Such imperial Mogul vandalism lies hidden from the public. This room is in the red stone storey immediately below the marble platform. Indian history has been turned topsy turvy in lauding destroyers as great builders.‚Äù [1]Photo # 23: ‚ÄúMany such doorways of chambers in secret stories underneath the Taj Mahal have been sealed with brick and lime. Concealed inside could be valuable evidence such as Sanskrit inscriptions Hindu idols the original Hindu model of the Taj the desecrated Shiva Linga Hindu scriptures and temple equipment. Besides such sealed chambers there are many which are kept locked by the Government. The Public must raise its voice to have these opened or it should institute legal proceedings. Shree P. N. Sharma of Green Park New Delhi who peeped through an aperture in these chambers in 1934 A.D. saw a pillared hall with images carved on the pillars.‚Äù [1] [2] [3]Photo # 24: ‚ÄúBurharpur is a very ancient historic city on the Central Railway between Khandwa and Bhusawal junctions. Burhanpur and the nearby Asirgarh (fort) used to provide hospitality to Hindu royals proceeding north or south on pilgrimage weddings or military expeditions. Barhanpur has many magnificent mansions which are currently being described as mosques and tombs of alien Islamic invaders. This building is one such ancient Hindu royal palace captured by the Moghuls. Mumtaz died here during her 14th delivery around 1630 A.D. while she and Shahjahan were camping here. She is said to be buried in a Hindu pavilion in front of this palace.‚Äù [1]Photo # 25: ‚ÄúMumtaz is supposed to be buried in this garden pavilion of the ancient Hindu palace (Ahu Mahal) 600 miles from Agra in Burhanpur. Another version says that Mumtaz‚Äôs corpse was kept here exposed to sun rain and wild beasts for six months. The date of her death the date of her removal from Burhanpur to Agra and the date of her assumed burial in the Taj Mahal are all unknown because the entire Taj Mahal-Mumtaz legend is a concoction from the beginning to end. [Mumtaz was only one of several hundred wives and women that Shahjahan kept in his harem.]‚Äù [1] [2] Descriptions of the Photographs of the Red Fort and Other Buildings in Delhi and Elsewhere in IndiaPhoto # 26: ‚ÄúThis tablet raised inside Delhi‚Äôs Red Fort by modern archaeologists proclaims that Shahjahan (who ruled from 1628 to 1658 A.D.) built this fort from 1639 to 1648 A.D. As against this see the [next] photo of the painting of Shahjahan‚Äôs time preserved in the Bodleian Library Oxford. It depicts Shajahan receiving the Persian ambassador inside the fort in 1628 the very year of Shahjahan‚Äôs accession. Obviously the fort existed much before Shahjahan.‚Äù [1] [3]Photo # 27: ‚ÄúThe 5th generation Mogul emperor Shahjahan is credited with having built the Red Fort in Delhi. Shahjahan ascended the throne in 1628 A.D. This contemporary painting shows him receiving the Persian ambassador in 1628 itself in the Diwan-i-Aam (Common Room) of the Red Fort itself. This painting preserved in the Bodleian Library Oxford was reproduced in the Illustrated Weekly of India (page 32) of March 14 1971. Since Shahjahan was in the fort in the year of his accession this documentary evidence disproves the notion that he built the fort. Compare with this the photo of the tablet in English raised inside the fort by the Govt. of India‚Äôs archaeology department asserting that Shahjahan built the fort during 1639-48. This is emphatic proof of Indian history having been thoroughly falsified during Muslim rule in India.‚Äù [1]Photo # 28: ‚ÄúThe Red Fort in Delhi has in its Khas Mahal alias the King‚Äôs apartment the royal emblem of its builder King Anangoal. It consists of a pair of swords laid hilt to hilt curving upwards the sacred Hindu pot (kalash) above the hilts a lotus bud and a pair of scales of justice balanced over it. Dotted around are representations of the sun from whom Indian ruling dynasties claimed descent. At the sword points are two small conches considered sacred in Hindu tradition. Bigger conches may be seen at the left and right corners at the base. This royal Hindu insignia of the Hindu king who built Delhi‚Äôs Red Fort is still there in the Khas Mahal pavilion. But even this visual symbol has been blatantly misinterpreted. The two swords laid hilt to hilt curving upward are being inadvertently styled by ignorant guides archaeologists and historians as an Islamic crescent. The sacred Hindu Kalash (water pot) on the hilts is never noticed. The lotus bud on the kalash represents royal wealth. The pair of scales is symbolic of impartial justice.‚Äù [1]Photo # 29: ‚ÄúThis perforated marble screen inside the Khas Mahal (i.e. the King‚Äôs own chamber) in Delhi‚Äôs Red Fort is a Hindu specialty. Such jalees are mentioned even in Ramayanic descriptions of palaces. Therefore some buildings claimed to be mosques in Ahmedabad which boast of such exquisite jalees (lattices) are Hindu edifices. The Hindu royal emblem mounted on the upper part of the jalee disproves that the Mogul Shahjahan built the fort.‚Äù [1] Photos # 30 & 31: ‚ÄúThe resplendent Hindu midday sun (from whom Hindu rulers claim descent) in the arch above flanked by the sacred Hindu letter OM. Below it is the royal Hindu insignia. This proves the hollowness of the claim that Shahjahan commissioned the Red Fort.‚Äù [1] [2] [3]Photo # 32: ‚ÄúIt is entirely false that the Red Fort of Delhi was built by Shahjahan in 1639-48 A.D. Muslims were the destroyers of statues. Then why should they have constructed statues? But there are statues of Hindu Mahavants riding the elephants of the doors of each interior room of ‚ÄúKhas Mahal‚Äù in the Red Fort. On the main gate of the Fort named ‚ÄúDelhi Darwaja‚Äù there are huge statues of elephants. The curtain of building statues of elephants on forts and palace gates can be well judged by examining the palaces at Gwalior Udaipur and Kota. Decorating homes forts palaces and temples with elephants is a hoary Hindu tradition. To the Hindu an elephant symbolizes might power glory and wealth. The Red Fort in Delhi has life-size elephants at its gate and elephants with riders atop its door knobs in the Khas Mahal pavilion. Had Shahjahan built the fort such Hindu motifs should not have been there.‚Äù [3]Photo # 33: ‚ÄúA close up of the elephant and rider door knob in the Khas Mahal of the Red Fort in Delhi. This is a typically Hindu motif. Other big life-size stone elephants decorating the Naqqar Khana (Music House) gate were slaughtered by Islamic invaders. The chopped up pieces may still be seen stored in the Khas Mahal basements. The public must insist on these being joined and displayed.‚Äù [4]Photo # 34: ‚ÄúInner view of the entrance to the so-called Moti Masjid inside Delhi‚Äôs Red Fort. The archaeological tablet outside claims that the mosque was built by Aurangzeb son and successor of Shahjahan. That claim is baseless because (1) The entrance is of a temple design. (2) The arch between the domes is made of banana bunches used in Hindu worship. (3) On either side above the arch are fruit trays. (4) Naming buildings after gems (Moti means pearl) is a Hindu custom. (5) If Shahjahan built the fort why didn‚Äôt he provide it with a mosque? (6) The truncated Hindu perambulatory passage may still be seen to exist on the building‚Äôs left flank.

The arch at the bottom may be seen to be made of banana bunches. On either side above the arch are trays holding five fruits each as holy Hindu offering. Fruit is taboo inside Muslim mosques.‚Äù [1] [4]Photo # 36: ‚ÄúThis temple-front design of ribbed gourd-like domes on either side with a pinnacle surmounted by a canopy in the centre embossed on the riverside wall of the Rang Mahal apartment inside Delhi‚Äôs Red fort is emphatic proof that the fort is a pre-Shahjahan Hindu fort. Even the name Rang Mahal is Hindu. In this same pavilion is carved on the floor an exquisite lotus in full bloom as a fountain trough. Muslim walls and floors are plain. The canopy in the photo may be seen at several Hindu altars. The kalash (pot) under it represents divinity in Hindu tradition.‚Äù [1]Photo # 37: ‚Äò‚ÄùVishnu‚Äôs footprint‚Äô in the so-called Humayun Tomb New Delhi.

Le Bon‚Äôs original French book published in the 19th century) by David Macrae Tudor Publishing co. New York 1974. This photo proves that the so-called Humayun mausoleum is an ancient Hindu temple palace. Inquiries with archaeologists in Delhi drew a blank They have never seen these footprints which indicates that they are heir to a lot of non-information and mis-information. Humayun is not at all buried in Delhi. According to Farishta‚Äôs chronicle (English translation by John Briggs Vol. II page 174) Humayun is buried in Agra while according to Abul Fazal (Elliot & Dowson Vol. VI page 22) Humayun lies buried in Sirhind.‚Äù [1] [2]Photo # 38: ‚ÄúA panel of the so-called Kutab tower in Delhi. The exquisite serpentine Hindu pattern in the upper part is the wreath called ‚ÄòMakar Torana‚Äô because it emanates from the mouth of a crocodile. This is a very common sacred Hindu motif in historic buildings. The Islamic tampering and forgery in stone may be seen in the lower portion. An attempt has been made to plant Koranic lettering. Such forgery in stone fooled even historians who thereby inadvertently ascribed those buildings to Muslim authorship.‚Äù[1]Photo # 39: ‚ÄúThis remnant of a temple around the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi has been named ‚ÄòKuwat-ul-Islam‚Äô mosque by the conqueror Kutubuddin in the closing years of the 12th century A.D. The term signifies ‚ÄúThe Strength of Islam‚Äù in capturing and battering a Hindu temple and blatantly using it as a mosque. Ignorant historians who could not explain away the Hindu workmanship foolishly concluded that the Muslims demolished some other temple and carried the Hindu pillars hither to raise this ‚Äòmosque (?).‚Äô This is an absurdity from every point of view. Muslims only seized Hindu temples and pressed them into service as mosques.‚Äù [1] Photo # 40 & #41: ‚ÄúMuslim captors dismantled surface stones of the so-called Kutab tower in Delhi reversed them and inscribed Koran on the exterior. This Muslim forgery in stone came to light as those stones started falling off the tower. Here we can see the Hindu images on one side while the next view Photo # 41: reveals the subsequent Islamic lettering on the other.‚Äù [1]Photo # 42: ‚ÄúFour miles from the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi is an ancient Hindu temple palace currently known as Sultan Ghari. An uncrowned son of sultan Iltmash (around 1230 A.D. ) is believed buried in it. That is a myth because there is no grave there. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in its ceiling. The beams of the octagonal crypt bore figures of Kamadhenu (celestial cow) and Varaha ([Lord Vishnu‚Äôs incarnation as a] wild boar). A Muslim tomb would never sport two highly detested animals. These two animals were a royal Hindu insignia. Even today five such pig-faced drain pipes may be seen projecting out of the walls of the royal pavilions inside Delhi‚Äôs Red Fort. Had Shahjahan built the fort as is currently believed he wouldn‚Äôt have had pigs peering from over his royal Islamic head since pigs are deeply detested by Islam. Contrarily the wild boar is an Hindu incarnation and sacred royal Hindu emblem. This is one of the visual proofs of the Hindu origin of Delhi‚Äôs Red Fort. So careless has been the study of Indian history that such graphic proofs have remained unnoticed. For similar more evidence read Mr. P. N. Oak‚Äôs research book titled ‚ÄúDelhi‚Äôs Red Fort is Hindu Lalkot.‚Äù [This photo was repeated elsewhere in the album under which was a caption that was completely different. You may want to read it as well which follows:]‚Äù [2] [3] [1] This ancient Hindu royal emblem of a wild boar (left) and the cow was found engraved on a lintel of what has been euphemistically called Sultan Ghari four miles from the Kutab Minar in Delhi. This proves that the so-called tomb was originally a Hindu palace. Like thousands of other buildings throughout India that palace too was pressed into Muslim use. Sultan Altmash‚Äôs son is believed to be buried there. Yet the tomb is not known after him but merely as the ‚ÄúSultan‚Äôs Cavern.‚Äù Scholars have been wrong in believing that the building was built after the prince‚Äôs death. All such mediaeval tombs and mosques are erstwhile Hindu palaces and temples. That is why their decor is entirely Hindu. Historians and archaeologists hard put to explain away Hindu decor of what they believed to be Muslim buildings improvised the absurd justification that the building must have been fashioned out of the debris of some Hindu buildings or that the workmen being Hindu built in the Hindu style. Both these arguments are wrong. No building worth its name can be built out of debris. Similarly no workman ever dare or would ever care to fashion a building for which he is hired according to his own taste opposed to that of the owner‚Äôs. In this case the lintel was plastered over when the building was used as a Muslim tomb because the Islamic conscience cannot tolerate idolatrous images. Such tactics were used by Muslim invaders in all lands they overran when making use of captured buildings. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in the roof of the building. The building is octagonal in shape which is also a Hindu specialty. This royal Hindu emblem and another found in the Red Fort in Delhi stress the need for historians to look for and collect all such ancient Hindu royal emblems. This is a very enchanting and engrossing task that faces all those who are interested in rewriting Indian history after a millennium of Islam distortion and destruction.

Legends have recently sprung up around the place with comparisons made to the different rocks making up the arch and the Lord‚Äôs conch discus etc propagating the belief that this is where the Lord entered Tirumala!The formation is categorised as pre-Cambrian that dates back to millions of years. The age of the rock itself has been estimated to be about 2500 million years and the age of the arch is computed to be about 1500 million years! There are various schools of thought about the origin of the arch. Some are of the view that it could be the effect of a wave action from oceanic transgression or intensified climatic settings and corrosion. Others opine that it might have been carved out of quartzite or simply by the weathering of the rock. However no matter how the arch came into being it is certainly unique for this is the only such formation in Asia. It is believed to have only two similar formations in the world‚ÄïRainbow Arch Bridge of Utah in the USA and the arch that cuts through the Dalradian Quartzite in the UK. Mythology related to the arch linked to the famous Tirumala hills temple of Lord Venkateswara has three versions. According to one version the arch resembles the hood of a serpent a conch (Sanskrit: Shank) and a discuss (Sanskrit: chakra) ‚Äì all symbols of worship in Hindu religion ‚Äì and considered to be the source of the Idol of Lord Venkateswara or Lord Balaji at the Tirumala hill temple. The second version is that the main deity in the Tirumala temple is of the same height as the height of the arch. The third version is that Lord Vishnu known as Balaji or Venkateswara (the central deity of Srivaishnava tradition) at the Tirumala temple town is supposed to have put his first foot down at a place called Padalu or Sreevaripadalu (Telugu language: Divine foot prints) which is the highest point of Tirumala hills the second step at the location of the arch. Thereafter the next step is stated to have been placed where his idol is now worshipped in the temple at Tirumala Today the Sila Thoranam is not really a secret. The TTD (Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam) runs regular buses to this place and autos are also available from the temple. A garden has been developed around and it is good to see that this rare feature is getting the importance it deserves!

Of the four major shrines of Vrindavan Govinddev temple also called Govindaji temple enjoy the special place and is considered as the most finest and the exceptional piece of religious edifice that Hindu art and architecture has ever exhibited in the northern part of India. The central tower of the main temple building is seven storeyed and resembles the form of the Greek cross.The central part of the temple is surmounted by a dome of exceptionally elegant magnitudes and the four arms of the cross are roofed by the vaults like those of the arches as in the Gothic Cathedrals rather than those of the traditional Hindu architecture. The temple is built up of red sandstone and is adorned with elegant dome archways and wall surfaces which are intricately carved and decorated giving it a warmth and magnificent look.The experts describe the temple‚Äôs architecture as a most harmonious and exceptional combination of dome and spire and quote it as a great crux of modern art. Govind in Sanskrit literature means the God of Cows. This temple along with the four other presiding deities of Gopinath Jugal Kishore and Madan Mohan mandir are the oldest of all and are believed to be installed by King Vajranabh( great Grandson of Krishna) about 5000 years ago. But during the course of time the deities were lost. It‚Äôs believed that once when Sri Rupa Goswami was tired of searching for Yoga-pitha (actual place where deity of Govindaji was hidden) he sat down under a tree resting and chanting the bhajans of Lord Krishna near the bank of river Yamuna. Suddenly then he was approached by a small cowherd boy who told him that he has seen a cow who goes up a nearby hill everyday and pour its milk into a hole. There is some mystery behind that he (Rupa Goswami) must see. Rupa Goswami visited the place as told by that cowherd boy and started digging that hole. There he found the beautiful deity of Lord Govindaji in his threefold bent form. He incapable of building a temple for Govindaji requested Raja Man Singh of Jaipur to build the temple. Thus influenced by Shrila Rupa Goswami Raja Man Singh who was the follower of Raghunath Bhatta built this magnificent temple of Krishna in Samvat 1617 i.e. A.D. 1590.The altar of the temple was made from marble decorated with gold and silver. On the west end of the main temple is an inscription that is too much disfigured but is revealing the fact that the temple was built in Sambat 1647 i.e. 1590 A.D. under the direction of Guru Rupa and Santana Goswami by Raja Man Singh the son of Maharaj Bhagwan Das. According to the historians Akbar had donated some of the red sandstone which was brought for Red fort to his then general Raja Man Singh of Jaipur for completing this magnificent temple.During the tyrant attack of Aurangzeb on Vrindavan the temple was ordered destruction and the Mughal troops destroyed its four storeys.In prior anticipation of this invasion the temple dirties were transferred to Jaipur secretly and since then the original dirties of Lord Govindaji is worshipped there in Jaipur . During the British rule from 1873-77 the main structure of the temple was repaired again and a new temple was built behind this temple where the Pratibhu Vigraha (replica) of lord Govind dev is worshipped along with the deity of Sri Radharani which was the first deity of Radharani to be installed anywhere. It was sent by Purusottam the son of king Prataparudra from Jagannath Puri to be installed by the side of Govindaji. In the southern part of the temple there is a cave where Rupa Goswami used to meditate and where the deity of Govinda was found  there is installed a deity of eight armed Yogmaya Devi sitting on a lion. Earlier the deity of Vrinda Devi was also installed in this temple which was later on moved to Kamyavan for safekeeping during Mughal attack. Thanks and Sri Radha Govind Dev Ji please merciful on us

Do Vrindavan and Mathura have a lot of temples? If so why are there no footpaths in these cities?,https://www.quora.com/Do-Vrindavan-and-Mathura-have-a-lot-of-temples-If-so-why-are-there-no-footpaths-in-these-cities
,,Yes Vrindavan and Mathura are famous for their numerous temples and are considered as two of the holiest cities in India for followers of Hinduism. Vrindavan is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Krishna and is considered to be one of the seven holiest places in Hinduism making it an important pilgrimage destination. As for the lack of footpaths in these cities it could be due to several reasons. One possible reason is the limited resources and infrastructure in the area leading to a prioritization of other development needs over the construction of footpaths. Another reason could be the lack of proper planning and management by the local authorities leading to a neglect of pedestrian infrastructure. It is also important to note that Vrindavan and Mathura are relatively small towns and the streets and roads in the area are not designed to accommodate heavy pedestrian traffic. The traditional design of these towns is such that people walk on the sides of the roads which can be hazardous particularly for the elderly and children. In conclusion despite the lack of footpaths Vrindavan and Mathura remain important pilgrimage destinations attracting thousands of visitors every year.
RelatedCan Mormons enter a temple (with a recommendation) just for the sake of going in or can you only enter the temple when there for a ceremony?,https://www.quora.com/Can-Mormons-enter-a-temple-with-a-recommendation-just-for-the-sake-of-going-in-or-can-you-only-enter-the-temple-when-there-for-a-ceremony,,I respect the various opinions expressed in the answers to this question and this is one great thing about being a Latter-day Saint; there‚Äôs no indoctrination and everyone is welcome to interpret the doctrine according to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

My mother often goes to the temple with my father (i.e. every other time) who is a temple worker but as she is legally blind she cannot read the cards and so prefers to remain where she does not need to serve. The Montreal Quebec temple does not have a Chapel but only a waiting room with a tiny dining room; my mother can often be found there and she entertains those who arrive and wait for a session to start. No one at the temple will ask what you are doing there unless it is either for small talk or because they need you somewhere. There is no sign up or any time limit in being there. Of course the best place to be waiting is in the Celestial room but you must have served somewhere in order to enter. That‚Äôs the only restriction I know. One evening the temple had just opened and everyone but me (about 6 people) were in the opening session. (This is the time when only temple workers can enter past the front desk.) There came one member who was visiting from Columbia and he was with a non-member friend. As he was early and seeing nobody around he asked if I could allow him to tour the temple for his friend. I apologized and invited him to the lounge. He stayed there for about 15 minutes then left. He did ask however to take a picture in front of the temple and I gladly helped them with that. Temples are really a piece of heaven on earth where everything is done orderly and without any stress. Just being there is comparable of being alone in the woods‚Ä¶ where there is only nature and peace. The difference with that though is that there is a sense of purpose in the temple that does not really exist in the wilderness. To me anyway.

Another example would be how certain countries officially record your religious affiliation and then make it just about impossible to change it especially if that affiliation is Muslim. The key item in any such cases is the matter of how the individual self-identifies. We don‚Äôt care if another church or a government considers you to be a member of another religion. However if you consider yourself to be a member of another religion that is a pretty serious thing. The only possible exceptions might be for religions that border on philosophy and don‚Äôt have any direct conflict with our teachings. For example Confucianism. Another thing to note is that there are often cultural things that people do that may seem religious in nature but aren‚Äôt really. An example is the ancestor worship I saw in Taiwan. Members of the Church who live in Taiwan will frequently ‚Äúpray‚Äù to ancestors but the reality is that they don‚Äôt view that in the same way as their prayers to God. And the reality is that it is just a more formalized version of what many members of the Church already do in other countries anyway.

In the temple we make covenants with God that we will follow His Son Jesus Christ and commit our all to Him and in return God promises that we will receive the blessings of exaltation after the Second Coming of Christ. Sounds like a lot? It is. Making promises with God is no small matter. And the only place you can do that is in the temple. That‚Äôs why we celebrate: another House of the Lord for us to enter and sample what heaven will be like. Another place where we can experience part of what it will be like to be in God‚Äôs presence. So we celebrate. We gather all the saints in the area where the temple is being constructed. We perform cultural dances and sing songs that remind us of the people who live in the area and how they now have local access to the House of the Lord. We praise the builders and those who will work and volunteer inside the temple. Finally we dedicate the temple to the Lord offering it to Him as a house where we can enter and be taught. This shouldn‚Äôt be seen as weird. Just take a look at what goes on in your community all the time. People hold ribbon cuttings for new businesses and hospitals. We have grand openings for car dealerships and parties for new restaurants. It‚Äôs no strange thing to celebrate the opening of a new building that will benefit the residents of that area. When a new literal house of God is finally ready for His people to enter that they can learn how they can receive all the blessings He wants them to obtain in this life and the next it rightfully should be the most important grand opening celebration of any building on Earth because of what it means for everyone: God lives; He loves all His children; He speaks to each of us individually; He sent His Son Jesus Christ to prepare us to return to God and become like Him; and the temple is where those truths are taught best.

The vision is recorded in 1 Nephi chapter 8 and Nephi records the interpretation starting in chapter 11. I highly recommend you read these excellent chapters! The tree of life and its amazing fruit are likened to the love of God. The rod of iron that people hold and follow to the tree is the word of God. By holding fast to the word of God we are led to the tree and the love of God. The temple endowment is a blessing of knowledge and covenants that we make as individuals. It builds on and enhances the covenants we make when we are baptized. These covenants of keeping the commandments sacrificing to build up the kingdom of God on the earth and serving to help and lift others can help keep us holding fast to the iron rod or the word of God and help move us forward on the path to reaching the full love of God.

Let me explain my experience before I explain why this isn‚Äôt an unreasonable devotion. Before I went to Tirumala I was a Mumbai-girl with zero interest in religion. The only reason I wanted to go to Tirupati was because I needed to go on a trip and everyone in my family voted for Tirupati. When I first arrived I found Tirumala to be unusually peaceful. Yes there are crowds of devotees but the air is clean the environment is fresh and the roads are clean. I loved that vibe. We had the darshan on the following day but I was impressed by the scenery of the bright temple grounds nestled in the hills. That made the trip worth the effort. Then I had the darshan. We stood in line for over five hours and the press of crowds was intense. I didn‚Äôt lose my patience or became angry with the close body contact with so many strangers. In fact I had fun observing people from so many different walks of life. When I entered the Sanctum I forgot everything. I‚Äôm typically a little selfish and like to be happy and comfortable in my life. I would be the first to complain about long ques and two-second darshans but I could see the Lord the moment I entered and He arrested me. All notions of asking Him for something or gaining a boon simply flew out of my head. It was netra darshan that day so we could go close and His eyes were visible and not concealed by the namam. I am not an emotional or sentimental person so I was very surprised that I had tears in my eyes. I didn‚Äôt take my eyes off Him and got very close. At that point I had only one prayer in my mind guard my father if he is with you. My father had passed away over a year before this darshan. That was my most unselfish and pure wish. Nothing else came to my mind during the darshan but my father and my God. People at Tirumala typically push devotees away to get them moving. I was pushed towards Him three times and they shouted at me to get proper darshan. I had. One single breath of contact with Him is more than enough. You don‚Äôt have to sit and stare at Him for hours. A single moment in His presence can fill you with powerful vibrations and cleanse you. I came out of the temple mind simply blown. The experience was astonishing and visceral unlike anything I had ever gone through before. Now I try to visit Tirupati every year and every time I go I feel all my work stress and pressure melt away. I don‚Äôt go there to get a wish granted or ask for boons. That‚Äôs a myth and selfishness. We‚Äôre asked to surrender not demand. I surrendered. When I go there my mind becomes blank and clean. The entire darshan experience is just a way to communicate with the God. I smile when I see Him that hand gesturing towards his feet to surrender. I feel protected welcome and warm. That‚Äôs the allure of Lord Venkateshwara. Of course I have felt the same allure at every ancient Vishnu temple I have visited but I can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs there. I still approach religion and practices with open eyes and a practical mindset but there is a lot of solace in this. People visit Tirupati for a number of reasons. Some want their wish granted some believe the power of the God will cure their ills some believe they must. Some are like me and go there just because they want to visit the God and bask in His presence. There‚Äôs nothing unreasonable about this. It‚Äôs an experience. It‚Äôs spirituality and devotion. This has the power to heal and help you recover from deep emotional pain. Of course if someone doesn‚Äôt have the spiritual clarity or an open mind they can simply dismiss this as unreasonable. You have either not visited Tirumala and seen Him or you haven‚Äôt kept your mind open. People who get frustrated about Tirupati often let the press of crowd and long ques overwhelm their experience. They keep complaining about the long wait the exhaustion and don‚Äôt experience the energy and vibrations generated by thousands of devotees. The simple fact is unless you experience it yourself you won‚Äôt understand it and you‚Äôll keep calling it unreasonable devotion. Word of advice don‚Äôt bash it without trying it. People do experience something when they go to Tirumala. If you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs on you buddy not on the God or the temple. He is open to everyone but not everyone is open to Him.

Konstantin had created a device he named GVC which is based off the the ancient Chinese system of energy meridians. It measures the bio-energy that all living organisms give off through a non invasive painless evaluation. It uses a small electrical current that is connected to the finger tips and takes less than a millisecond to send signals from. When these electric charges are pulsed through the body our bodies naturally respond with a kind of ‚Äòelectron cloud‚Äô made up of light photons. This glow can be captured with an optical CCD camera system and then translated onto a computer. Each sect of the finger tip represents different organs and systems in the body. A computer program projects the figure of a body and places a type of auric cloud around it that is in correspondence with each chakra. According to the ancient Ayurvedic Indian medicine each part of our fingertips correspond to different body parts and systems within us. They also say that there are 7 main energy points along the center of out being as well. Konstantin took this idea and applied it to his technology. The different coloured balls represent each chakra and how much work we need to put into it mentally physically and emotionally. The farther off it is from the center the more that specific chakra needs working on. This can translate into physical life if your throat chakra is off that can mean you need to work on speak up. If your heart chakra is off that can mean you need to practice compassion and understanding with the people in your life. Korotkov also used a type of Kirlian photography to show the exact moment someone‚Äôs soul left their body at the time of death! He says there is a blue life force you can see leaving the body. He says the navel and the head are the first parts of us to lose their life force and the heart and groin are the last. In other cases he‚Äôs noted that the soul of people who have had violent or unexpected deaths can manifest in a state of confusion and their consciousness doesn‚Äôt actually know that they‚Äôve died. This method has been used by over 300 doctors around the world who have used it for monitoring stress and even treating things like cancer. Many doctors are finally starting to understand that many ailments stem from an emotional disruption first and then manifest into a physical illness. The more we can understand the depth of consciousness and how it affects our physicality the more we can explore medically. Sources: 1

All over the world including India many people might know about Odisha as a small state in East India but the name of Puri certainly has a high recall value across the world for being the land of Lord Jagannath which is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra. Jagannath Puri being one of the four dhams sees millions of devotees visiting the Jagannath temple throughout the year seeking the blessings of Lord Jagannath. The historic Jagannath temple (Shrimandira) at Puri was built in the year 1078. The following nine incredible facts about the temple do not have a logical explanation. 08 The flag atop the temple has been observed to flap in the opposite direction of the breeze. 07 Irrespective of where you stand in Puri it seems to you that the Sudarshana Chakra on top of the temple is always facing you. 06 Usually in coastal areas during the day-time the breeze blows from the sea towards the land and during evening hours it blows from the land towards the sea. But in the case of Puri it is the reverse. 05 No birds fly above the Jagannath temple in Puri. 04 The shadow of the main dome of Jagannath temple is not visible whatever be the time of day. Maybe an architectural feat or the Lord‚Äôs desire. 03 The food cooked inside the temple everyday will not go waste. 02 After entering the temple from Singha dwara‚Äôs entrance after the first step you cannot hear any sound produced by the ocean. But when you exit it can be clearly heard. This can be noticed clearly during the evening. There is no scientific explanation for this. Legend has it that Subhadra Mayi the sister of the two Lords wished peace and serenity within the temple abode and hence it was made to come about that way. 01 The Ratha Yatra at Puri was initially performed with two sets of chariots (3 plus 3). As there was a river flowing in between Shrimandira and Gundicha (Mausi maa) temple the first set of chariots were used to transport the Deities till the river and then the Deities had to cross the river in three wooden boats and then board the other set of chariots to travel till the Gundicha (Mausi maa) temple Every year there is a place just ahead of the Gundicha temple where the procession comes to a stop by itself. This is a mystery. The temple doors are closed to the public after 6 P.M. and in spite of elaborate planning the proceedings are delayed in every Yatra. Thereby this delay gives an opportunity for the thousands of devotees to have darshan of the Deities at a time which otherwise would not have been possible in the precincts of the temple. Probably it is the Lord‚Äôs way of conveying that all mortals are alike in His eyes.

The Chakras are the concentrated energy centers of the body. Chakra is a Sanskrit term and means "wheel" or "disk" and is derived from the root word "cakra". The chakras are rotating wheels of energy / light. The chakras have a loving responsibility to assimilate incorporate and emanate energy to keep us functioning at optimal levels. We have major and minor Chakras We have major and minor chakras in our energy body systems. When a chakra does not work properly or if it is blocked a disease is more likely to occur. Our well-being at all levels can affect and is affected by the chakras Heling. If we feel depressed we may not be absorbing the maximum amount of energy for our needs. If we don't nourish our bodies with the right foods and nutrients then we can consume less energy than more. If we "block" feelings like anger etc. or don't tell our truth we may be unconsciously preventing our flow of healthy energy.How to strengthen and improve the flow of your chakra systems On the other hand if we strive to work on our physical emotional mental and spiritual health we can easily promote the flow of energy through our chakras. Yoga is a way for example that we can work to strengthen and improve the flow of our chakra systems. Eliminating the disorder in our lives physically and emotionally helps strengthen the flow of our energy. Forgiveness greatly improves our energy health. Of course Reiki helps strengthen the body's energy flow to regain balance and promotes well-being at all levels.

Chakrapaani means the one who holds Chakra on his hand and Sarangapaani means the one who holds the bow Saranga on his hand. Both the names refers to lord Narayana himself thus both are Narayana deities. When Lord Chakrapaani is worshipped separately in his temple he is Lord Sudarshana (Narayana) and when he is placed together with lord Sarangapaani he will become Hetiraja Sudarshana but Lord Sarangapaani will remain the same.

They symbolize the infinite rotation of energy. Chakras are a part of the subtle body and cannot be physically seen but yogis believe that balancing the chakras is essential for mental and physical health. There are 7 main chakras in the body which broadly coincide with the main endocrine system. Each chakra has a color a mantra and a symbol associated with it which may be used for  meditating upon that chakra. Each chakra may also be visualized as a wheel with a fixed number of spokes or a lotus with the same number of petals. As Vagmi Mudumbai has explained the 7 chakras are located along the sushumna nadi (corresponding to the spinal column) with the Ida and Pingala nadis intersecting them. As the kundalini rises along the sushumna from the base (Mooladhara) to the crown (Sahasrara) it awakens each chakra. All 7 chakras must be awakened for samadhi (bliss) and moksha (freedom) to be attained. A blocked or over-active chakra will cause illness and disease in it‚Äôs associated organ system or area of consciousness.

If something is best it wont be cheap.I remember I once read in a laundry shop that you could only get only 2 things at the same time from the below three.cheap price.best qualityFast delivery.If you are getting something cheap and good quality then it would for sure be slow!If you are getting the best quality and faster delivery it won't be cheap then!If you are getting something for less price and time then the quality would be low for sure.Hence in a nutshell and to conclude what you asked there are no such channels that could guarantee you success in the stock market! But your zeal to learn tricks strategies and positive attitude would take you in that direction. In the Stock market you need to control only 5 below things. If you could control them together can help your nerves and not actually doing random trades you would never be at loss.Greed.Fear.Anger.Ego i.e.Respect the market trend.AttitudeYou can do a bad trade once twice or thrice but if you control these properties you won't be at loss for a longer time. **Keep a positive attitude and enter a trade based on the market behavior trend and strategies with a strict stop loss and not on the basis of your personal opinion/ gut feeling or as per any channel advice. Your Ego would double your loss. Because it would tempt you to recover the loss you got in the previous trade even though you are done with the trading attempts for the day. Your attitude would keep you floating in the market even in the bad times.Look at me: I entered the market in Dec‚Äô2017 had no knowledge did some random trades and kept on buying stuff just like that. got invested with 8 lacks. kept on buying yes bank when it was falling invested in bad stocks like rcom videocon. and today my portfolio is worth 5.2 lacks i.e. loss of almost 3 lacks and no interest in my principal.Then I heard of the FnO and tried trading in it randomly and lost 1.2 lacks in the first year :D majorly because of 4‚Äì5 trades which were worth 15‚Äì20k loss each order. Why did I have the big losses in those trades because of no control over my Ego Stoploss practice Anger.This year I have got a loss of just 4k till now in the current financial year-5 months :D So I am considering it good progress. I am trying to control those 5 things.I have full confidence that with time I will be able to create strategies that suit my level of fear and greed. I have a positive attitude to change those losses in past into the profit not immediately in a single day/ trade/ month but slowly and gradually while learning new practices while respecting the market trend. :)I hope my answer would help in some way.

I remembered on the 14th of April when I was listening to Ariana Grande songs a notification popped up on my screen from the channel named turbo looters then I opened the channel and they are stating about the Earphone loot deal with the redirecting link to Amazon.I immediately opened up the link because I got curious to see that deal. Will you believe me If I say that I bought this earphone for free? Let's see I'll show you the screenshot I took when the order is placed.IMAGE SOURCE : (Amazon Flipkart and my gallery) Although the order is placed still I am in a little doubt about the successful delivery. See I am a shopaholic but I never purchased this type of loot deal that's why I was thinking that Amazon will cancel the order until the order delivered to my house. I ordered it on 14th May and got that on 17th May. The funny thing is the delivery boy also asked me mam can you tell me how you ordered it free of cost then I told him also about Turbo Looters telegram channel. If you want to join this channel I will provide you a link. Click here to join turbo looters I was very excited to see the earphones and you won't believe it but bro it is the same as it is shown in the picture.So this was my best loot deal I have ever purchased from online shopping sites. Note this is my favorite product I have ever purchase but it does not mean that after that I never bought awesome deals. I also purchased some more loot deals with the help of my favorite channel.

RelatedWhy does the corporate world sometimes feel like it's so full of bullshit?,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-corporate-world-sometimes-feel-like-its-so-full-of-bullshit,https://qsf.cf2.quoracdn.net/-4-images.new_grid.profile_default_anonymous.png-26-a62b84947fe6f16f.png,There is a distinction between "creating value" and "demonstrating value". When you're working alone they are the same thing because you can focus on creating value and don't need to prove to anyone else that you've "earned your paycheck". As you add more people and "accountability monitors" (aka middle-managers) the more everyone feels the need to demonstrate their contribution. Whether any contribution is actually made or not becomes a secondary concern - everyone only cares about "how they looked" to their superiors. Any value that gets created is purely as a side-effect. In small companies this gap between value creation and value demonstration is easily managed. But the gap widens alarmingly fast as company size increases. In publicly listed companies even the CEO only cares about how he/she looks to the board and to shareholders.  But of course nobody will openly admit this. Obviously a system in which everyone actually only cares about A while only pretending to care about B will collapse under the weight of its hypocrisy and what's left is a pile of bullshit.

Brahma requested Vishnu to lie down and block the waters from interfering with his yagna. After the completion of the rituals Lord Mahavishnu emerged from the sacrificial fire dazzling with the brilliance of a thousand suns. The original image of Lord Varadharaja was made of Attimaram and this ancient wooden image is kept in a silver casket immersed in water. This wooden image is removed from the water and worshipped for 10 days once in forty years. The temple is famous for its spirituality and ancient history. It is built on 23 acres of land and surrounded by several prominent temples of various deities. A significant feature of the temple is the beautifully engraved lizards plated with pure gold. The temple lies inside three grand circles and has a magnificent hall of 100 pillars. The presiding deity is a 10 feet tall Idol made of granite in a standing posture The Lord is self-manifested (Swayambhu) and not installed by any human or divine being.The temple is a masterpiece of Dravidian architecture and reflects the craftsmanship of ancient Vishwakarma Sthapathis. The temple houses not less than 32 shrines 19 Vimanas 389 pillared posts and several sacred tanks. A striking feature of the temple is the huge stone chain sculpted out of a single stone. The 100 pillared hall inside the premises features several sculptures depicting scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

In the olden days the main sanctum was constructed on chosen geographic locations with higher cosmic energy which would be surrounded by the large temples and common to many villages. The temple structures were huge enough to accommodate hundreds of people inside and they could walk around freely. There is so much to explain but I shall keep it short with few important information: 1. Temples were built in the precise location to channel that cosmic energy to all who entered the temple. (This you can feel in the old temples). 2. Temple tower (gopuram) is pyramid shaped and directly above the sanctum which is topped by several metals this is in particular to absorb and harness the energy from the sun and the cosmos. Now the sanctum itself wouldn't have any windows or additional doors that might let the energy escape. The only way out is through the pravesha dwara (main door) where the disciples have to gather. This ensures that the positive energy be felt by everyone gathered.Image source: google 3. These temples have many herbal plants and trees and it is religiously believed that circling these trees is very beneficial. The real reason for this practice is that just by walking around the trees breathing fresh air would keep the our immune system strong against many diseases. 4. The god idols are sculpted from specifically selected stones and metals which again contains many traces of minerals which is believed to store the cosmic energy like a battery. These idols are further enriched with many offering such as curd honey milk sugar rose water sandalwood and many more items by performing Abhishekam. All these offerings are given to devotees in one or the other form. Sometimes as Prasadam or sometimes are paste which is generally applied on forehead. The Prasadam helped many poor people in the surrounding villages with nutrition fulfillment who may not even afford all the elements offered.Image source: google 5. Many old Large Temples served as treasure houses for the kings and also had underground tunnel system so in case of danger the King could flee through these secret underground tunnels to a safer place. 6. Many of the offerings like Theertham or Holy water in the temple are generally filled with herbs which protected the devotees with general health. 7. Indians generally walk around their homes barefoot this is especially emphasized in and around the mandir viz. the temple. This is practiced ideally to keep off the germs and mud carried by the dirty shoes at bay. It is also because the nerve endings at one's foot are massaged and acts as a great acupressure when we walk barefoot.Image source: google 8. Apart from all these scientific perspective temples were looked at more as a place where one can let go of his daily ordeals and find peace. The channeled positive energy reciting of shlokas grounds us down and we will be able to concentrate better.

First claim that idol (moola virat) is not shown is completely false as there exist a Seva at Tirupati call Nijapada Darshanam on friday where idol is decorated with minimal ornaments any one can see the idol of deity clearly wearing just a lowin cloth. Yes it is true that there are no recent pictures of the deity without any decoration but there exists a rare video of the deity in black and white taken during british time. This video is the only authentic source of the idol available. Picture from the video is attached below.tirupati original idol video Skip to 39 minutes in the video link attached above to watch original video of idols abhishekam without any ornaments and decorations. As you can see clearly lord has a attached crown itself . No jain idol has any kind of crown adorned with it. Idol can be seen with a dhothi also crafted with stone none of these features match any jain idol. Claim that lords curly hair is covered with the golden crown. Yes it is true that lord has long curly hair on his back unlike curly hair of any jain idol. Also curly hair is not distinct for only jaina sculptures most of stone idols of many relegions bare this resemblance. 2. As for the second claim that the idol is of Lord Neminath is completely baseless. This is the digambara idol of lord Neminatha.This is the replica idol of lord Balaji.As one can see clearly that there are no astounding resemblances to the two idols. Lord Balaji‚Äôs pose is unique in stance having four hands two raised upwards and lower right hand showing Varada hasta and left hand showing Kati hasta. Lord has Godess Lakshmi crafted on his chest. On stark contrast jain idols normally never have any ornaments crown and that distinct pose of the idol at Tirupati crafted within the stone idol. Moola virat(idol) of lord is very special and is believed to be extra terrestrial object. Many miracles have happened over the years proving lords existance. So it can be ruled out that the idol belongs to Lord Neminath. 3. Third claim is interesting as it is 100% true that lord does not have any shanka or chakra embedded on the idol itself but that does not mean that lord does not have four hands. Two of the upper hands are in the pose of getting hold weapons in both the hands as you can see in the picture below.No jaina idol has a pose showing four hands and with upper hands holding any kind of weapon. Lord Balaji has a unique story of why the shanka and chakra are missing. In a popular story lord presents his ardent devotee king Tondaman with his weapons to fight a war and also predicts that they will be returned by another devotee many years later. As predicted Sri Ramanujacharya presented with those weapons much later. 4. It is not true that there are no literary evidences of Tirupati being a vishnu temple. Even being a jain Tiruvalluar mentions about Vengadam. Silapathikaram mentions Lord Venkateshwara as an incarnation on Lord Vishnu. Vishnu purana also mentions Venkateshwara as the main deity of kaliyuga. Some argue that Venkateshwara mentioned by Tiruvalluar and also in Silapathikaram represent jain god. As the name suggests Eshwara means a hindu god either Shiva or Vishnu. The above facts seem i think disprove all the claims ‚Äú with respect to everyone". All are free to visit the temple and offer their worship but not to play with other relegions beliefs with false claims. Everyone is welcome to the abode of lord. Be it Lord Neminatha or Lord Venkateshwara or Lord Buddha God is what you see and believe. Reach the abode of lord you shall find peace. Myself am a ardent devotee of Lord Venkateshwara. Even after all these confusions we cannot deny that Tirupati is one of the most famous relegious place in the world much credit goes to hindus that. ‚ÄúVenkatdhri samam sthanam brahmande nasthi kinchana Venkatesa samo devo na bhuto na bhavishyathi" Meaning: There is no Shrine equal to Venkatdhri and there is no God on par with Lord Venkateshwara. ‚Äú OM NAMO VENKATESHAYA ‚Äú P.S: Pardon any mistakes and make necessary suggestions to make corrections. Healthy debates are encouraged. Thanks for reading. Edit: Changes in Lord Neminatha idol.

June 1 and 2 is the earliest safest date.In the month of May end and June you will find less flower. Flower variety is generally white. The advantage of this time is that you will the the chosen few in this area with no crowd and experience the calmness and vastness of Valley of Flowers in a very unique way. No crowd. Less chances of heavy rain till 10th June. Spend qaulity time in Valley. July and AugustThis is the time when Flower is bloomed fully of red colour. Totally green full of flower. Drawbacks are Either too crowded or sometime you may not reach valley of flower due to bad weather at joshimath and other areas from where we reach to valley of flower. September till October 5greenery is there. more colder flower start getting brown. more greenery and less of full bloom flowers. 3. You need either special training or tour operator to visit Valley of Flower.. Answer: . Not At all. All you need to have a healthy normal body and better planning..If you are coming from Delhi my suggestions are as follows: Before starting Journey: Have a good trekking shoesGood SunglassesSunscreen lotion the above three is must. Due to high UV ray your face skin burn is a sureity. Good trekking shoes will help you in trekk the very steep trek from Ghangharia to Valley of Flower. Every shoe is different and trekking shoes are perfect.

Hindus built temples for at least a millennium before that quite possibly much longer but they were smaller and more perishable structures intended only to serve spiritual functions; no one much cared how visually impressive or long-lasting they were. It was around the 500s C.E. that Hindu kings really began to build large spectacularly impressive temples as a display of vast wealth and power in addition to for spiritual reasons. Once some of them started the trend caught on and widely swept Hindu lands as many kings adopted it.

There could be a lot of unhygienic things that one could have stepped on including human/animal waste. This is one of the reasons for wearing footwear in the first place. As the footwear is dirty it is unworthy of entering a house let alone a temple. Another reason is respect. It is like a European taking off their hat.

Then comes along a white lady with her camera and start taking pictures the ladies got distracted and started posing for the camera to the end that the white women was directing them on how to stand to get the best light etc. And in the meantime bhava was lost. Who is to blame here? But then there is no guarantee that every Hindu who visits a temple has similar devotion. Nor is that all non-Hindus come to gawk as tourists. So it is a call the temples have to make there is no perfect solution to such.  In my opinion given my experience of Abrahamic religions where they think to pray to "idols" is bizarre and exotic. I rather fall on the other side of the line that they should not be allowed to visit the Shrines. A Hindu can visit a Church or a Mosque for a simple reason that a Hindu does not consider such a worship as pagan heathen or mushrik. The Hindu does not stand in judgement. But Abrahamics do stand in judgement upon other religions. I do not want to invite someone to my home knowing that their motives are thus. And I don't want my heritage to be gawked at or our practices - as though we are performing monkeys in a circus act. Sure there will be exceptions to this but it is near impossible to verify. So for now I think it is better policy to keep them away.  Be it USCIRF or people like Jeffery Kripal trusting them and giving them access has turned out to be a bad choice for us. For they end up demeaning what we value.  We should stop being suckers for the "white person's opinion" we are proud that they appreciate our art heritage etc. But every time this has lead to that particular art or custom being stripped of its dharmic moorings and marketed as a "secularized" exotic product and slowly appropriated. I know it is not intuitive for us to be suspicious. But it is better we learn from History.

Every Hindu home has their own shrine or temple so there is no need to use a temple unless you want to have darshan of the God or attend a festival or meet people. In the olden days temples were like modern malls - there were markets entertainment food stalls etc. all within the temple compounds. So people went to temples for social reasons as well as religious. Invaders into India destroyed temples because they thought that by doing so they would extirpate Hinduism. It worked against the Buddhists because all their monks scholars books and learning were concentrated in monasteries - so by destroying them and slaughtering the monks the religion went into decline. But because Temples are not important for Hindus their destruction did not result in any change in the status or force of Hinduism.

The previous incarnations of Swamy Ayyappa were not Brahman but just partial incarnations. I will not include the legend of Wawar as I am still researching about this legend related to Ayyappa.STORY OF AYYAPPA: Mahishi‚Äôs boon and terror After the death of Mahishaura his sister Mahishi swore to take revenge on the Devas and started to perform penance to gain a boon from Brahma Deva. Her penance went on till Kali Yuga. Finally Brahma Ji appeared in front of her. She asked Brahma Deva to grant her immortality which Virinji refused to grant and asked Mahishi to ask any other boon. After thinking for a while she asked that only the son of Shiva and Vishnu who in his teen can slay her. Brahma Ji blessed her with the boon she also further asked for missiles which Brahma Ji granted along with an infallible mace. After she received the boon she seized Swarga and threw Indra Surya Yama Brihaspati from Swarga. Indra‚Äôs Vajra could not scratch her due to the boon. While the Devas were running they meet Devrishi Narada. Hearing about what had happened Narada Ji asked the Devas to visit Brahma Ji. When asked for a solution Brahma Deva tells them to talk to Shree Hari. When the Devas approached Shree Vishnu and asked him to help them. Shree Hari stated that when Mahishi‚Äôs crime and sins increase at that time her boon itself would turn into a curse and would become cause of her downfall.When the Devas ask as to where they should go to take shelter Narada thinks of a plan and tells the Devas. Narada approached Mahishi and tells her that she had to return to Patala and rule the Asuras and she could not stay in Swarga permanently. Hence he suggested appointing Indra as a caretaker and told them that she could visit Swarga and torture the Devas at her will. When she agreed to Narada‚Äôs proposal the Devas were brought in and Narada instructed them to serve Mahishi. Narada also tells Mahishi that the Devas get their strength from Yagnas and Homas. Hearing this Mahishi starts to molest and harass all the Rishis. Birth of Swamy Ayyappa: When Mahishi had crossed all her limits all the sages and Devas gathered and started to perform penance to ask Shiva Ji and Vishnu Ji to produce a child. After listening both of them appear. Mahadeva takes the form of Chandrashekara and Vishnu Ji takes the form of Mohini and marry each other. Hence Bhagwan Shiva is also known as Vishnu Vallabha. Both of them have a child together. Their child was a complete manifestation of Brahman. Mahadeva took his Ghanta and tied it as a pendant on the neck of the child.On the other hand the king of Pandalam Rajashekara was childless. Both he and his wife worshipped Shiva and Vishnu asking for a child. One day when the King went out to scare the wild boars into the forest he came upon the divine child of Shiva and Vishnu lying near a Shiva Linga and protected by serpents. The king wished to embrace the child but hesitated thinking the parents of the child would return. Shiva in disguise as a saint arrives at the place and instructs the King to adopt the child. The King and the sage have a conversation and the sage finally convinces the King to adopt the child. The sage named the child Manikantha and tells the king that the child was destined for greatness.Youth of Ayyappa: After the King adopts Manikantha the minister of the kingdom gets worried. He has planned to ascend the throne after the Kings death as Rajashekara has no children. Since Manikantha‚Äôs childhood the minister tried to kill him in various ways but fails miserably. After Manikantha received his complete education he fights with a powerful dacoit named Udayanan and slays him. The minister then poisons the mind of the Queen and conspire against Manikantha. The queen acts as if she is ill and her pain was insufferable. And as the royal doctor supported the minister he helped them in their plan. The doctor told the King that the only way to cure her was to bring the tigress milk and that too the tigress had to be brought willingly. Ayyappa decides to bring the tigress even when his father tries his best to stop him.Death of Mahishi: At this time Narada informs Mahishi about the child of Mahadeva and Mohini. Hearing this she becomes enraged and also was consumed with feat at the same time. One of the Asuras advised Mahishi to force the Devas to hand the Amrita to her so she could consume it and become immortal. She then goes to Swarga and starts torturing the Devas and asks them to hand over the Amrita. Narada Muni appears in front of Ayyappa who is looking for a tigress in the dense forest and then praises him and informs Manikantha about the situation. Hearing this Ayyappa reassures Narada Muni and then leaves to eliminate Mahishi. Ayyappa sees Mahishi torturing the Devas and then challenges her for a duel. Mahishi on seeing Ayyappa is infatuated by his beauty and asks him to bed her which he refuses and states that he is an eternal Brahmachari and has taken birth to eliminate her. Enraged by this he throws her Brahma mace. He shatters her infallible mace with his ordinary arrows and also destroys her weapons and celestial missiles. He later engages in a physical battle and overpowers her and then slays her using his staff and throws her body from Swarga which falls on Bhu Loka.Aftermath: Mahishi gets freed from her curse. She was a nymph who was cursed by her Guru to turn into an Asuri. Later Ayyappa gives her a place in his temple to his left. He tells her that he would marry her only when there is no new devotee visiting him. After killing Mahishi Ayyappa is showered by flowers and Mahadeva and Vishnu arrive and instruct him to reside in Sabarimala as the Diety for Kaliyuga hence he is known as Kaliyuga Varada. Indra takes the form of the Tigress accompanied by the nymphs also who took the form of a tigress and then accompanied Ayyappa to the palace of Rajashekara Pandalam.Seeing this the queen is overwhelmed by Ayyappas love towards him and asks for forgiveness. Rajashekara realises the words of the sage who he had met when he adopted Ayyappa and bows to Ayyappa. Ayyappa crowns his younger brother as the heir to the throne and takes up Sanyasa. Rajashekara asks Ayyappa to ask something in return for all his work. Ayyappa shoots an arrow and tells his adopted father that wherever the arrow strikes he would reside in that place and that land was to be donated to him. Then Ayyappa takes Samadhi to that place and resides in the form of the idol.Later as per Manikanthas words Bhagwan Parshurama constructs the temple premises and worships Ayyappa Swamy.OM NAMAH SHIVAYA JAI SHREE RAMA SWAMIYE SHARANAM AYYAPPA

Obviously our festival days dictated by laws of nature and those are days that we make a deliberate attempt more so than other days to try and to do what is required. For reference in our languages we observe each day as governed by certain grahas out of the nava-grahas. adivaram (sunday) is surya bhagavan (sun) somavaram (monday) is chandra bhagavan (moon) mangalavaram (tuesday) is angaraka (mangalam) bhagavan (mars) buddhavaram (wednesday) is buddha bhagavan (mercury) guruvaram (thursday) is brihaspati bhagavan (jupiter) shukravaram (friday) is shukra bhagavan (venus) sanivaram (saturday) is shani bhagavan (saturn) These bhagavans represent the governors and influencers of different aspects of the human physiology (including mind) and impact our hormonal nervous and immune systems as detailed in the yoga shastras. There is also an intimate relationship to ayurveda i.e. the tridoshas which broadly serve as a systems-functional view of the human physiology: kapha (storage) pita (transformation) and vata (movement) representing the 3 most important processes at a macro level that need to be understood and managed well. So different days and different occasions require different observances different foods different rituals different actions (karmas) to be performed in order to maintain and evolve the spiritual potential of the human being. Classically temples were never places of ‚Äòworship‚Äô. This is a christian idea. Temples are nexuses of shakti that are used for spiritual growth to maximize receptivity of cosmic shaktis to be absorbed by the spiritual human being. The gopuram (top of the temple) is designed to receive these energies and to distribute it within the temple. The temple design itself is a representation of the spiritual body (panchakoshas) of the human being. The geometry of the temple and its arrangement is governed by principle so vasthu (spatial geometry and its influence on architecture) and jyotisha (astronomy). Temples were constructed in places where something spiritually significant happened in order to capture and distribute the energy of that to the seeker. The human being is largely the human body (5 or pancha - koshas [sheaths]) which comprise the subtle information associated with the gross body. These sheaths respond to the environment because an individual is not an island they are part of everything around them. When the moon affects the water bodies and tidal forces do you think that it has no effect on the human body which is also comprised of mostly water? The moon also has strong influence on the glandular system in the body. Women‚Äôs menstrual cycles are closely related to the moon‚Äôs 28 day cycle; which we divide into krishna paksha (the dark fortnight) and shukla paksha (the bright fortnight). The entirety of nature influences the human body in cycles. This was well understood by Vedic civilization and mapped out in great detail. Of the actual planets in our solar system Rshis determined that the most significant influences came from these particular grahas (bodies) which either impact the earth-sun relationship (being part of the inner orbit they come ‚Äúin between‚Äù) or they are so large that they induce physical effects in other ways. Temples themselves receive energies from the environment and pass them along to the people who visit indiscriminately. The sun doesn‚Äôt first ask you if you are Hindu Muslim Christian Man or Woman before it gives you light. Upon receiving these influences different bodies react differently; highly spiritually sensitive bodies know how to leverage this shakti for spiritual development. Likewise temples indiscriminately throw off positive vibrations to the people who visit them and absorb negative vibrations from them. These have physical psychological and other effects which someone who has deep sensitivity to the way their system functions can learn to harness ‚Äî in other words a sadhaka (seeker) who follows our spiritual processes. Thus because temples are actually shakti peethas (energy foundations) there are prescriptions for who can and cannot visit them ‚Äî some temples are for men only some are women only and some are for both. One should learn to respect these prescriptions or they can wreak havoc on your spiritual process. You are blind so you must put your trust in the wisdom of the Rshis who could see. Rshi means one who has achieved a certain very high level of consciousness near to the supreme consciousness itself. You may not recognize gender but your body does. The body is designed in a particular way. Its hormones its glandular functions etc. all work in a particular way. So what is prescribed for one gender doesn‚Äôt necessarily mirror for the other gender. The prana works differently in those bodies. The preferences and beliefs of the human intellect has no place here; it is the biology and its interactions with the environment that take precedence. Your feminism and gender equality ideas don‚Äôt mean a thing to the body; it follows ruthlessly what nature has set in play. You don‚Äôt control menstruation for instance it controls you. Likewise you don‚Äôt control your hormones they control you. The glands and the yoga chakras control you not the other way around. Your body will do whatever they command. They receive their commands from the nature around you. When it is time to start functioning in a particular way they will start functioning that way without question. When it is time to stop functioning a particular way they will stop. Human beings can try to mess with biology but it won‚Äôt lead to your happiness ‚Äî it will only lead to you disrupting an extremely long-lived intelligence and that will not end well for you. The body is far more intelligent than you are. It knows how to handle itself in any situation.

The renovation works have to be done and any repairs should be immediately done without any delay so that there is no pending work and the devotees must not be given trouble. This can also be attributed to the Vaastu Shastras and we have to keep the buildings of the temples and sculptures well preserved. Painting must be done at least once in a year to keep up the image of the temples and surrounding temple properties also must be maintained by the Temple management and authorities. For this very purpose the wealthy Kshatriyas and Vaishyas in the past were donating Gold Jewelry Money Lands and kind for the upkeep of the Temples in India the Shudras were also donating their crops and bountiful agricultural produce to the Temples and would offer service to the devotees without accepting any money as a form of service. A well maintained Temple will get a lot of visitors and devotees and we can get to see them in Pilgrimage centers and in famous shrines across India and in other parts of the world. For achieving this Hindus of All Castes and walks of life have to generously contribute towards the funds and ensure that we collectively maintain cleanliness in the temple and it's vicinities.

This is important because the community is best aware about the nitty-gritties involved on a day to day level for such a community place. Also it is the responsibility of the community to not only sustain such places but also contribute to the larger cause of the nation. Administration of such institutions which have a direct effect on the religious belief system and faith of many followers should be done from within the community. Primarily because the person following the same belief system shall tend to be more knowledgeable in their own religion and hence be able to conduct the affairs of the institution in a diligent fashion. If one chooses to have such administration either in the hands of the government or any person outside the community they would be playing for apathy mislead and misuse of assets available. Hence the all such institutions should be managed from within the community. This answers the generic question on who should administer religious institutions. Coming to the more specific question asked about Hindus I would like to ask a counter question would Christians and Muslims want people from outside their religion following a different belief system to administer their religio-social committeees and churches/mosques? We may hazard a guess to what the answer might be. In the light of the answer how fair is it to ask a Hindu temple to be administered by a non-Hindu person? Morya!

Change the temple laws to only allow Hindus in if you wish. But as long as men of other religions are allowed to enter blocking non-Hindu women will be no different from blocking Hindu women.

Now i think that it will give a fair idea about the answer to the question. The temple is the main source of energy(similar to the large water storage tanks). And one interesting point about Hindu Temple is about the various methods that are followed before the construction erection of GodGodess etc. Be it God or Goddess they are mostly sculptured out of stones. First a right stone in the form of a rock is selected on an auspicious day and is taken to the highly skilled sculptors place. He is generally a descendent of a traditional family by gene He is supposed to follow strict living conditions when he is on the job like he should be pious no family life! no non-vegetarian food. His entire concentration is focussed on carving an idol from the rock. There are idols in many South Indian Temples where expressions like smile shy etc. could be noticed. Particularly there are many in the famous Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai Tamil Nadu. After completion of the statue from rock form the idol is immersed inside the water nine kinds of pulsesgold/silver coins for 48 days. Now one may question that why for 48 days. It goes like this. There are 9 Planets 12 Rasis and 27 Stars hence it covers all these planets rasis & stars.

There was never a dictat of religious brotherhood that we find strongly in Islam. Even Christianity doesn't seem to have this. Despite their diversity Hindus always respected the temples of other regions. If one Hindu kingdom conquered another Hindu kingdom bloodshed was limited to the battlefield only.

It is an amalgamation of diverse and often contradictory philosophies. As such there is no one way of doing things. Many people choose to worship a personal deity in their own way. Some go to temples regularly and conduct rituals prayers and meditations. There is no prescribed day to go to a Temple and one is free to go anytime. The temple practices are not akin to the practice of religious services followed by Abrahamic religions. The temple is a place which can provide a conducive atmosphere for meditation. It is NOT a place of worship as worship is a personal matter. Most of the festivals are based on the seasonal changes and agricultural patterns. These vary from different parts of India as India is a huge country with varying climatic patterns. So a single festival can be celebrated in a 100 ways within a single state of India. There is no prescribed way of conducting ones life and one is free to choose how one wants to live. The essence of Sanathana Dharma is Freedom any binding rule is seen as antithesis of this fundamental aim. So anything is welcome as long as it is peaceful and non-violent. We are not even required to accept or believe in the existence of God as Sanathana Dharma also includes and welcomes atheistic view points. The presence or absence of a ‚ÄúGod‚Äù is irrelevant to the most essential aim - that of ultimate liberation from conditioned existence. Rituals temples prayers ceremonies are all just there to make our lives more colourful and it is not something that we need to take seriously.

After being ridden of her sins in her earlier life as a Rakshashi Mahishi( after being vanquished by Lord Ayyappa himself) reincarnates as Sri Malikapurathamman.When she expresses her desire to marry Sri Ayyappan He informs her of his decision to remain a celibate bachelor until the end of Kaliyuga. To signify the time when he will marry her He informs her that on the year when she does not find a Single Kanni Ayyappan ( a male Ayyappa devotee coming to Sabarimala for the first time)turning up for Darshan  by placing the ceremonial arrow in Saranguthi Peetamwith irumudi Kettu on his headis when she can seek to marry him.Until then he vows to stay celibate and not allow women of menstrual age to visit him.Also he requests her to take her abode in her temple adjacent to His abode and take care of and bless his devotees. In this background Historically the Sabarimalai temple has had very restricted period when temple was kept open.During Mandala period for 41 days and during Makara Jyothi Only.With the passage of time invoking Deiva Prashnam or Divine Intuition the days of opening the temple were extended to the first five days of every Malayalam month as well as during Vishu and other important festivals.This was also done to accomodate the ever increasing spate of devotees from the world over to have His Divine Darshan.

Where do we begin? Our main drawback was we were repulsive to Change/Adaptation. Hindus stuck to tradition culture etc. Change was always despised frowned upon. Thus even after centuries people attire lifestyle (At-least in rural areas) are still same over time things change but we held on to it. There is good and bad to it. Some of the cultural behaviors were like not arguing with elders respecting elders teachers sticking to the elders decisions without questioning etc. While it is very good practice sometimes too good could become bad. So elders get offended if younger generation don‚Äôt obey them or question their decision. Same thing happens in everyday life hierarchy in everyday life. Village head expects greetings from commoners district chief expecting respect from village head and so on. Small ignorance/mistake like not gifting or gift not upto expectation to higher ups brushes the hierarchy ego in a wrong way. The fragile egos get shattered worse than piece of glass. This seeps into every day life for eg: A Girl‚Äôs side has to forever entertain their Son-in-Law‚Äôs side and so on. So whenever the country was attacked by outsiders there were more jealous people inside than the number of enemies outside. Castles were repeatedly attacked but arming lower caste people was out of question. Because prestige was more important. Neighboring kings refused assistance because they felt humiliated for silly reasons like not getting honored enough during last party etc. We restricted 30% of the population from taking up arms restricted women folks to participate in any economical/martial activity and on top of that never changed our defense/attack technique. Because the one designed it is a scholar and no one could challenge him. This is one of the reason we lost many battles. This Ego would never let Indians unite and always draw us backwards So you see this ego is still carried into 21st century. A Rajput considers him higher in hierarchy compared to Baniya & Brahmins while Baniya considers him richer than both and so on. Grandfather would consider it an insult if his grandson refuses to obey him. This is the reason we are opposed to Love marriages even in 21st century. For thousands of years people working in these industries were shunned by general class people ie: Meat Fisheries Tannery Laundry etc. This was because they were considered lower class and they smelled. They were denied services from priest or doctor (Vaidya). Thus they were always low hanging fruits for other religion people. So you see I would say not Hindus but Indians in general are wrong in not changing our thought process and holding on to our false Ego. Its time to let go elders should be open to suggestions from younger generation hierarchy shouldn‚Äôt be given that much importance. In USA the president shakes hands with the Janitor here IAS officers might not even touch a peon. Student not understanding should be looked as a need for improvement to teacher and not fault of child. I could go on and on but you get the point right? Yours J. Bhai

Every Ayyappa devotee before he sees the Sanctum Sanctorum has to lay his footsteps over eighteen sacred steps. Initially the 18 steps were made of granite. It was later covered with Panchaloha (a special composition of gold silver copper iron and tin) in the year 1985 to prevent it from deterioration. Pilgrims initiate their ascent up the Pathinettam Padi by placing their right foot on the first step. As per the tradition only those who undertake the penance for 41 days and those who carry the irumudi on their head are allowed to use the steps.The symbolism of these 18 steps is as follows: The first five steps symbolise the five human senses (Panchendriyas) i.e. visual (vision) auditory (hearing) olfactory (smell) gustatory (taste) and tactile (touch). These signify the `mortal‚Äô nature of one‚Äôs body. The next eight steps symbolise the eight Ashtaragas viz Kama Krodha Lobha Moha Madha Maltsarya Asooya Dhumb (Love Anger Avarice Lust Pride Unhealthy Competition Jealousy and Boastfulness). The next three steps stand for three Gunas or Thrigunas (nature-born qualities) i.e. Satva ( perspicuity discernment)  Rajas (activity enjoyment) and Thamas (inactivity stupor). The last two steps represent Vidya (Knowledge) and Avidya (Ignorance). It is assumed that after climbing up these eighteen steps reverently one symbolically detaches oneself from all the worldly ties that bind one physically and mentally to the world. It is only then that a person will be in a receptive condition to be ‚Äòone‚Äô in consonance with the concept of ‚ÄòThe Ultimate Creator‚Äô. The above are the most prevalently accepted version of the significance of the Holy 18 steps. Other versions are as follows: Ayyappa was a master of 18 weapons and the steps signify these. Ayyappa before merging into the idol at the Sanctum Sanctorum surrendered his 18 weapons one at each step of Pathinettam Padi. The steps represent the 18 hills existing in and around the region of Sabarimala.Ponnambalamedu Gowdenmala Nagamala Sundaramala Chittambalamala Khalgimala Mathangamala Myladummala Sreepadamala Devarmala Nilakkalmala Thalapparamala Neelimala Karimala Puthuserrymala Kalakettimala Inchipparamala and Sabarimala. Eighteen is considered as the code number to break into the soul of the Nature. The significance of 18 can be traced back to the Vedic age. The first Veda believed to be protected by Lord Brahma himself had 18 chapters. Later Veda Vyasa divided it to create the four vedas: Rigveda Yajur Veda Sama Veda and Atharava Veda. Each of these vedas had 18 chapters.Veda Vyasa also wrote 18 puranas and 18 upa-puranas. The Bhagavad Gita has 18 chapters and the Kurukshetra war lasted 18 days.There are many mythological stories associated with the holy Patinettampadi. Some believe the eighteen steps denotes the 18 puranas. Some believe that the first three steps depict ‚ÄúBhoomi Agni Vayoo & Akash‚Äù 6 to 9 steps for Karmendriya 10 to 15 for Jhanandriya 16th for mind 17th Intelligence and 18th Jeevathma Bhava. Those who cross all these steps are believed to achieve ‚ÄúPunyadarshan‚Äù. The steep steps are so important and holy that no one can climb them without fasting for 41 days and carrying the holy irrumudi on ones‚Äô head. Before ascending or descending the steps pilgrims break coconut as an offering to the steps. One needs to have the sacre Irumudi on head while going up or down the 18 steps. While descending the steps the devotees climb down backwards facing the sanctum sanctorum. One who climbs the Patinettampadi for 18 times shall plant coconut sapling in Sabarimala. Built on a plateau about 40 feet high the Ayyappan temple commands a lofty view of the mountains and valleys all around.Source: Ayyappa seva Sangham

This period is - unfortunately - rather poorly documented. But it was extremely important in the later development of rabbinic Judaism (all forms of Judaism today) as well as early Christianity. Basically during that period Judaism had both the traditional ritual temple practice with priests and levites engaged in daily sacrifices and temple rituals and at the same time synagogues scattered throughout Jewish areas with widespread popular teaching of such ‚Äònew‚Äô doctrines as Resurrection of the dead Judgement Day and an afterlife (none of those were traditionally part of Judaism as practiced in the Temple) the spreading of knowledge of the Law and Prophets among the general population (also relatively ‚Äònew‚Äô) and the rise of a holiness movement which stressed a personal relationship with God the importance of ‚Äòspirit‚Äô over rote observance and similar innovations of the Pharisaic movement most of which carried over into Christian thought and practice in the first century CE.

However parts of the megaron functioned as habitable spaces and were utilized as living quarters prior to the eighth century BCE. During the Greek Dark Age the buildings became smaller and less monumental. From some point in the 8th c. the temple and the residence were separated with the temple exhibiting a well-defined character based on the megaron plan. The first temples were mostly mud brick and marble structures on stone foundations. The columns and superstructure were wooden and door openings and antae were protected with wooden planks. The mud-brick walls were often reinforced by wooden posts in a type of half-timbered technique. The elements of this simple and clearly structured wooden architecture produced all the important design principles that were to determine the development of Greek temples for centuries.Different temple plans.

'dwelling' semantically distinct from Latin templum  " temple ") were structures built to house deity statues within Greek sanctuaries in ancient Greek religion . The temple interiors did not serve as meeting places since the sacrifices and rituals dedicated to the respective ouranic (a god or goddess that does not reside on the Earth) deity took place outside them within the wider precinct of the sanctuary which might be large. Temples were frequently used to store votive offerings. They are the most important and most widespread building type in Greek architecture . In the Hellenistic kingdoms of Southwest Asia and of North Africa  buildings erected to fulfill the functions of a temple often continued to follow the local traditions. Even where a Greek influence is visible such structures are not normally considered as Greek temples. This applies for example to the Graeco-Parthian and Bactrian temples or to the Ptolemaic examples which follow Egyptian tradition . Most Greek temples were oriented astronomically. [1] Early metope fill lichude museum at Paestum  depicting Heracles killing a giant Between the 9th¬†century¬†BCE and the 6th¬†century¬†BCE the ancient Greek temples developed from the small mud brick structures into double- porched monumental "peripteral" buildings with colonnade on all sides often reaching more than 20 metres in height (not including the roof). Stylistically they were governed by the regionally specific architectural orders . Whereas the distinction was originally between the Doric and Ionic orders a third alternative arose in late 3rd¬†century¬†BCE with the Corinthian order . A multitude of different ground plans were developed each of which could be combined with the superstructure in the different orders. Temples would be destroyed due to warfare in the Greek World or from lack of repairs. Some of these temples such as the temple of Poseidon Soter (The Savior) would be rebuilt outside of Athens after the defeat of the Persian Empire in 449 BCE. [2] From the 3rd¬†century¬†BCE onward the construction of large temples became less common; after a short 2nd¬†century¬†BCE flourish it ceased nearly entirely in the 1st¬†century¬†BCE. Thereafter only smaller structures were started while older temples continued to be renovated or brought to completion if in an unfinished state. Greek temples were designed and constructed according to set proportions mostly determined by the lower diameter of the columns or by the dimensions of the foundation levels. The nearly mathematical strictness of the basic designs thus reached was lightened by optical refinements. In spite of the still widespread idealised image Greek temples were painted so that bright reds and blues contrasted with the white of the building stones or of stucco .

The temple structures were huge enough to accommodate hundreds of people inside and they could walk around freely. There is so much to explain but I shall keep it short with few important information: 1. Temples were built in the precise location to channel that cosmic energy to all who entered the temple. (This you can feel in the old temples). 2. Temple tower (gopuram) is pyramid shaped and directly above the sanctum which is topped by several metals this is in particular to absorb and harness the energy from the sun and the cosmos. Now the sanctum itself wouldn't have any windows or additional doors that might let the energy escape. The only way out is through the pravesha dwara (main door) where the disciples have to gather. This ensures that the positive energy be felt by everyone gathered.Image source: google 3. These temples have many herbal plants and trees and it is religiously believed that circling these trees is very beneficial. The real reason for this practice is that just by walking around the trees breathing fresh air would keep the our immune system strong against many diseases. 4.

These idols are further enriched with many offering such as curd honey milk sugar rose water sandalwood and many more items by performing Abhishekam. All these offerings are given to devotees in one or the other form. Sometimes as Prasadam or sometimes are paste which is generally applied on forehead. The Prasadam helped many poor people in the surrounding villages with nutrition fulfillment who may not even afford all the elements offered.Image source: google 5. Many old Large Temples served as treasure houses for the kings and also had underground tunnel system so in case of danger the King could flee through these secret underground tunnels to a safer place. 6. Many of the offerings like Theertham or Holy water in the temple are generally filled with herbs which protected the devotees with general health. 7. Indians generally walk around their homes barefoot this is especially emphasized in and around the mandir viz. the temple. This is practiced ideally to keep off the germs and mud carried by the dirty shoes at bay.

From a historical point of view I can tell you that the Jews did not rebuild the temple after it was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE because every attempt to revolt against the Romans failed.  An estimated 500000 Jewish citizens were murdered during this time and you have to understand that the Jewish population back then is not what it is now so that large of a population decrease was critical and it became apparent that the only way for the Jewish people to survive was through dispersal.  thus the second diaspora began just as the first did with the destruction of Judaism's holiest site.

However throughout the empire in general and in the Land of Israel in particular a large portion of the population maintained its previous religion. In 361 the emperor Julian ascended to power in Rome and sought to restore the status quo and restore the Hellenistic religion to its greatness instead of the Christian religion. Due to these deeds he was called by Christian historians "Julian the heretic". Julian who was a sober statesman sought to bring closer to him the Jews scattered throughout his kingdom so that they would constitute a counterweight to the Christians. True in his philosophical writings he condemns Judaism (even if much less than Christianity and only as of the one who was the cradle of this distorted religion he says) but in his actions he did much to please the Jews. On July 19 362 Julian arrived in Antioch on his way to a war against the Persians. He found time to meet with the heads of the Jewish communities and asked them in the presence of his ministers why they did not offer sacrifices to their God. He knew the answer but he needed a public request. The Jews replied that they could not sacrifice as long as the Temple did not exist. In response the emperor swore to them (according to the contemporary historian Gregory of Nazianus): Julian responded to the statement with a promise of material assistance for the construction of the Temple as was the custom in Byzantium. Julian's goal was not to strengthen the Jews but to give a victorious blow to the Christians. These claimed that following the crucifixion of Jesus the work of sacrifice was nullified from the world along with the rest of the commandments made in the Torah. According to them the destruction of the Second Temple was not only due to the sins of the Jews but was part of the divine plan to establish a new kind of relationship between man and God and replace the old Hebrew religion with the new gospel that Jesus brought with him. Julian hoped that the resumption of sacrificial work in the temple would weaken the Christian claims. It is difficult to determine how the Jews reacted to the declaration of Julian since in the Jewish sources (of the time) there is no mention of the event and the reliance is on reports of chroniclers and Christian churchmen whose testimonies in this regard are clearly biased. The Christian historian Rufinus who lived in Italy reported that the proclamation aroused joy and exaltation among the Jews. According to him "the Jews reached such a state of insolence that some of them seemed to return to the days of prophecy and they began to insult our people (Christians) as if the days of their kingship had returned." The Jews in the Diaspora had another reason to rejoice because Julian abolished the special taxes for the Jews as well as the apostolic tax they raised for the president in Jerusalem. The Jews of the Land of Israel were also happy. There is evidence of the Jews of Tiberias wearing priestly garments blowing trumpets and even disturbing their Christian neighbors and burning down churches [Christian sources]. It can be assumed that those who wore priestly garments were the priests who responded with excessive enthusiasm since the work of the Temple is mainly related to them. With the proclamation the priests became a paramount factor in the preparations for the resumption of the work of the sacrifices. The sages also had a faith dilemma. (perhaps the reason why they didn't keep any records of this event) Is it possible that the temple was built by a pagan king who is not the Messiah son of David? However there were probably sages who tended to say yes which is an echo in the words of the Amora (the one who says) Rabbi Acha who said: "This means that the Temple will be built before the reign of the House of David." (Jerusalem Talmud Tractate Ma'asar Shani Chapter 5 Halacha II [56a].) The words of Rabbi Acha come as a continuation of the words of Rabbi Elazar who justifies the construction of the second house by Cyrus king of Persia and it seems that the words of Rabbi Acha come to hint at the permission for the construction of the house also by Julian. It is perhaps possible to deduce the opinion of sages from a somewhat similar case that happened in the days of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Hananiah in which Hadrian "decreed" to build the Temple. Possible evidence of popular enthusiasm can be found in a Hebrew inscription found engraved on the stones of the Western Wall under the Robinson Arch. Excavations conducted after 1967 found an inscription engraved in stone and says: "And you saw six of your hearts and bones as grass." This inscription is a distortion of the verse: "And you saw and your heart was glad and your bones were as grass; (Book of Yeshayahu chapter sixteen verse fourteen). The inscription taken from the prophecy of consolation to the days of the Messiah was found at a height of 6 meters above the level of Herodian Street the calculation of the area coverage in the sewage indicated the date of the inscription to the Byzantine period. Thus some speculate that the Messianic inscription was enthusiastically engraved on pilgrimage in the time of Julian. However not all researchers agree with this dating. The inscription is in fact a paraphrase of the verse from Yeshayahu because it differs from it in two details: it has the word "and their bones" written in it instead of "and your bones" and it lacks the word "will flourish." Therefore the Messianic spirit has been taken from it and it can be understood as a derogatory address to one who is buried next to her. Indeed during excavations conducted at the site by Roni Reich and Yaakov Bilig in 1994‚Äì1996 a cemetery was uncovered beneath it mostly of Muslims (laid on an east-west axis) and Christians (iron nails indicating the use of the coffin). Jews from the Diaspora began to gather in Jerusalem from the fall of 362 to the spring of 363. There is evidence of making silverware to process the altar stones because it was expressly forbidden to swing iron on them. The emperor during his stay in Babylon on the eve of the war with the Persians (March 363) reported to the Jews of the area: "I place with all vigor the new temple to the Supreme God." The first action taken was the destruction of building foundations on the Temple Mount. The Christians claimed that this was the destruction of the foundations of the Second Temple which Christians used to show as a remnant proving the righteousness of the prophecy of the destruction of Christ. However it is more likely that the Jews destroyed the foundations of the pagan temple in honor of Hadrian who stood there from the time of Ilia Capitoline. The demolition work continued until May 27 363. The cornerstone may have been laid on May 18 Lag B'Omer of that year as required by a study of the sources that dealt with the sudden cessation of the Temple upon its earthquake construction. Since their construction also began in the month of Iyar. Christian writers and historians tell that fire came down from the sky and burned the workers they tell of earthquakes every night of a huge cross seen in the sky and more. All this to prove that God's desire was to stop construction. This is the pagan version. As usual when Christians can divert an event to make it an opportunity to consolidate their faith which has no basis. A reliable report by a Roman military man tells of a nocturnal earthquake that ignited a flammable material (perhaps gases that had accumulated in an underground warehouse and exploded as a result of their emission inside mountains of debris in an airtight place) and caused a large fire in the Temple Mount area. It is also possible that a Christian hand was the cause of the fire which was not from heaven like many Hellenistic structures built by Julian and set on fire. On 26 June 363 in the indecisive Battle of Samarra near Maranga Julian was wounded when the Sassanid army raided his column. On the third day a major hemorrhage occurred and the emperor died during the night. This was the last attempt till today to rebuild our Temple. May Hashem has mercy on us and gives to us the real opportunity to get rid of the shame which stands today in its place and rebuild it.

The accuracy of these dates is contested by those who consider the biblical text to be of later date and based on a combination of biblical and extra-biblical historical records. There are contradictions between the records of different books of the Bible making the dates uncertain. However with a full reading of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah there were four (4) reported edicts to build and replenish the Second Temple and the city of Jerusalem. These edits were issued by three kings: Cyrus in 536 BCE (Ezra 1) Darius I in 519 BCE (Ezra 6) and Artaxerxes I in 457 BCE (Ezra 7) and finally by Artaxerxes again in 444 BCE (Nehemiah 2). It is possible that these accounts refer to the rebuilding of the temple and the rebuilding of Jerusalem separately but it is unlikely that the two constructions would have been separate in the minds of the Persian kings. This second temple stood (though molested robbed desecrated several times) for about 570 years. Herod the Great began a vast renovation and expansion of the temple in 20 BCE which continued for 46 years. The renovation was large enough and significant enough that the result is referred to as ‚ÄúHerod‚Äôs Temple‚Äù though it was still the ‚Äúsecond temple‚Äù not a third one. It was finally destroyed and burned by the Romans in 70 CE. The Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques have stood on the temple site since the mid 600s CE.

There are 51 Shakti Peetas across the country. The goddess residing place in Kanchi is called as ‚ÄúNabisthana Ottiyana Peetam‚Äù. The Goddess is called as ‚ÄúSri Kamakshi. The word is derived from the heritage ‚ÄúKa‚Äù means Goddess Saraswati (God of Education) ‚ÄúMa‚Äù means Goddess Lakshmi (God of Wealth) ‚ÄúAkshi‚Äù means Eye. The name as a whole refers as the god lives in Kanchi with Goddess Saraswati and Goddess Lakshmi as her both eyes. The Lalitha Sahasranama poem is an idle example for the goddess power. ‚ÄúSachamara Ramavani Savya Dakshina Sevitha‚Äù Kanchi is also called as Satyavrita Kshetra . The Goddess worshipped Lord Siva by creating a mud idol in Kanchi. At that moment Lord Siva incarnated as Kamba River with high tides to test the worship of the goddess the goddess grasped the idol closely with her two hands from eroding in the tides. This prevented the idol from getting eroded in the floods. The goddess also performed Pooja by sitting in a needle tip surrounded by ‚ÄúPanchakagni‚Äù (surrounded by 5 fires) to free herself from the interest of livelihood. The Lord Shiva became happy gestured before her and married the goddess. Though there are many Shiva temples in the city the only temple to have the sanctorum of the goddess is 'SRI KAMAKSHI AMMAN TEMPLE‚Äô. There are also eight other Shakti goddesses surrounding the temple. The place where goddess resides is ‚ÄúGayatri Mandapam‚Äù. The Goddess lives in temple in 3 forms. They are Sri Kamakshi Sri Bilahasam and Sri Chakram. The goddess is in a sitting posture of ‚ÄúPadmasana‚Äù .The goddess contains Pasa Angusa Pushpabana and Sugarcane in her forehands. The Goddess Mahalakshmi was given curse by the Lord Vishnu to incarnate as Aarupam form. The Goddess Mahalakshmi comes to Kanchipuram and performs the worship chanting in the name of Lord Vishnu to free her from this Aarupam. After long prayers the Goddess is freed from her Aarupam and given a Rupam by the Lord Vishnu. There exists a belief that Goddess kamakshi kumkum has to be offered to the idol of Aarupa Lakshmi within the sanctorum where by the goddess Lakshmi will fulfil your needs on the prayer. The temple sanctorum consists of a deity ‚ÄúAdivaraha Perumal‚Äù which is one of the 108 Vaishnaivaite deity worship temple. The history reveals us that King Dasaratha performed ‚ÄúPutra Kameshi Yagam‚Äù in the temple for the Birth of a child to his kingdom. The King performed pooja to the ‚ÄúNabisthanam‚Äù of the goddess in the temple. The King Dasaratha within a few months received a child. The King Dasasratha belongs to the ‚ÄúEkshuvagu Vamsam‚Äù where by the prime deity is Goddess Kamakshi. The extract of this story is visible in ‚ÄúMarkendeya Puranam‚Äù. The faith is if prayed truly the goddess provides child for the childless couples. The Saint Adisankara born at Kaladi in Kerala travelled across all the parts of the country. When he visited Kanchipuram he felt the goddess is in a ferocious mode that the entire sanctorum was very hot. So to personify her and accomplish to her to normal state the saint sung songs in the praise of goddess named ‚ÄúSoundarya Lahari‚Äù then he established a Sri Chakra in front of her idol to keep her cool and personified. This srichakram is visible to all of us and all the poojas are done to srichakram too. The Saint established Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam and attained Sarvagyna peetam in this holy city. The temple was visited by a dumb devotee named ‚ÄúMookan‚Äù. The devotee begged the goddess to free him from this dumbness so that he can perform poems on the praise of the goddess. The goddess suddenly provides him grace by freeing him from dumbness and giving him intellectuality in creating poetry. He was very happy with the goddess that he wrote a poetry named ‚ÄúMookapanchashati‚Äù in which he praises entirely about the grace of the goddess with her beauty. The temple goddess has been so graceful that she has made dumb to a poetist has given birth to the childless couples and provides wealth to all her devotees. The goddess destroys evil and helps the prosperity of goodness to prosper throughout the world. The special occasions for the Goddess Kamakshi are Navratri Bhramotsavam and Pournami (Full Moon Day). The goddess is distinctively powerful in these times and it is even more auspicious to visit the temple in these days. I wish all the devotees to participate in this special time and receive the blessings of the Goddess Kamakshi without fail.

The first Chandela king Chandravarman started the construction of these temples. Later on more temples were built during the reign of Yashovarman Dhanga and Vidyadhara. Khajuraho‚Äôs temples are spread in an area of 20 Sq Km. According to historical records there were 85 temples in the 12th century and at that time all were in active use. Khajuraho‚Äôs temples are dedicated to Hinduism and Jainism. The Hindu temples are dedicated to Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. These temples have intricate details fine workmanship and symbolism. When we talk about Khajuraho the first thing that comes to mind is ‚ÄúKhajuraho temple images‚Äù. These temples are beautifully carved and attract tourists from all over the world. There are three divisions .i.e. western eastern and southern. The western group of temples are most popular and have maximum places to see. These temples are one of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. These temples have nagara-style architectural symbolism and they are more known for its erotic sculptures. These Khajuraho temple images are most published all over the world. Most of the temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela dynasty. I came to know that there were 85 temples sites around the 12th century but now about 20-22 temples have survived. These temples are spread in 6-7 square kilometers.These temples are dedicated to Shiva & Vishnu and his affinities 1 to Ganesha 1 to Sun god 3 to Jain Tirthanks. This is one of the most asked questions about the sculptures on Khajuraho‚Äôs temples. Here I would like to clarify two things that these erotic sculptures are only on the outer walls of temples. Secondly as I mentioned in the beginning these sculptures are only 10% of the total statues on Khajuraho temples. It can be overwhelming or annoying for some people to see different sexual positions on temples walls. There seems to some myths reasons and stories behind these sculptures on temples walls. Stories of the...The most popular story is associated with the Chedela king Chandravarman. According to the legend a beautiful lady named Hemavati was taking bath in a pond full of lotus flowers on a full moon night. The Moon God Chandrama got fascinated with her beauty and approached her. After their romantic encounter Hemavati got pregnant and to hide her shame of being unwedded mother she went into the jungle and gave birth to a male child. When Chandrama came to know about the child he gave him a boon that he will become a king. Hemavati named the boy Chandravarman after the moon God and raised the child single handle. Chandravarman knew about her mother‚Äôs story and when he became king he built the temples. He ordered to engrave erotic sculptures on temple walls. Some say it is to portray sex as a natural act among human being and others say these are just to show the pointlessness of these acts.The second story comes from the local guide we engaged for our temple tour. According to him the erotic statues on temple walls were carved due to ‚ÄúTantric‚Äù influence. To prove his point he told us about the ‚ÄúChausath Yogini temple‚Äú. This temple of ‚ÄúDevi‚Äù is also in Western group of temples and have mystic around it. Chausath Yogini temple is considered as one of the most important temples among Tantric cult. He told us that men and women showed in different mating positions are the ‚ÄúMaithunas‚Äù. The Maithuns were the people who followed Tantra and Tantric practices in which sexual union is one of the important rituals. These sculptures of Maithuns were made to show their religious believes. Maithuns also believed that these relations among men & women are not just the physical union but it is a union in which men and women transfer their internal energy to each other which is a very important part of Tantric practices. Guide told us that during the mating time they attain the divine form of Shiva and Shakti. Maithuns considered it as the ultimate bliss which gives spiritual energy and a way to attain Moksha.The third story has a different angle. According to this in those days lots of people were influenced by the Jainism and Buddism. They were leaving their homes to live the life of monks. So to discourage them and to evoke their physical desires to live family life these erotic sculptures were made on temple walls.Another similar concept says that in those days young boys were sent to Gurukuls where they live in solitude away for family life. These boys don‚Äôt have any contact with women and girls so they do not know about physical relations. Before going into social life after completion of education these young men were sent to these temples to understand this part of life. The metaphors were made to attract and educate these young men about family life.
RelatedWhy are Khajuraho temples built? Who commissioned them?,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Khajuraho-temples-built-Who-commissioned-them,,These temples have been an enigma for all the time since they have been discovered. All kinds of insults and negative remarks have been heaped on Vedic culture for allowing such kind of sculpture to survive and that too inside a temple.Khajuraho Group of MonumentsFirst let me clarify one thing - These are not monuments dedicated to sex. Only 10% of the sculptures show amorous couples while others simple show facets of daily life. The Vedas advocate two ways of being spiritually enlightened - The PRAVRITTI MARGA (or the process of engaging your senses) and NIVRITTI MARGA (or the process of restraining your senses).   The basic principle for either of these paths is religious life. In animal life there is only pravrtti-marga. Pravritti-marga means sense enjoyment and nivritti-marga means spiritual advancement. In the life of animals and ordinary sense enjoyers there is no conception of nivritti-marga nor is there any actual conception of pravritti-marga. Pravritti-marga maintains that even though one has the propensity for sense gratification he can gratify his senses according to the directions of the Vedic injunctions.  For example everyone has the propensity for sex life but in demoniac civilization sex is enjoyed without restriction. According to Vedic culture sex is enjoyed under Vedic instructions. Thus the Vedas give direction to civilized human beings to enable them to satisfy their propensities for sense gratification.One thing which has always fascinated me is that even though mediaeval Bharat had all these things on public display we DO NOT see any record of rapes molestations eve-teasing and other crimes against women being on the rise. Neither Indian historians nor all the foreign tourists who came to Bharat ever mention them.

Out of all temples 6 are dedicated to lord Shiva 8 to lord Vishnu one to Surya Deva and one to lord ganesha and 3 to Jain tirthankars. Other temple ruins can't be exactly attributed to any god or faith. Although Khajuraho is famous for its erotic sculptures but in reality that is just a minor feature less than 10% of carvings and blend with the surrounding structures they neither stand out prominent nor are significantly highlighted at cost of others. One has to closely look at the sculptures to find them out. The most famous temples areKandariya Mahadeva TempleVishwanath templeJagadamba templeChaturbhuj templeLakshmana templeVamana templeMatangeshwar templeChitragupta templeDuladeo templeThe basic structure of the temple architecture remains Nagara style. Nagara style is famous form of temple construction in Northern part of India particularly north of Narmada. Odisha temples too have stylistical similarly and classified as north Indian nagara style. There is a central curved tower called as Shikhara. The central tower is present along with several small towers which rise in same flow with the main tower but are smaller in height. The temple is built usually on a raised platform and approached through stairways and there are no boundary walls that surround them. Stariways lead us to mandapa or a pillared hall where people used to congregate for important rituals or for temple art performance maybe for dance or music. Sometimes there was not just one mandala but two mandapas beyond which the main garbha griha (Sanctum sanctorum) was located where main deity is present. The temple architecture appears as if it resembles carving on sandalwood but in real it is work on sandstone. The temples particularly kandariya mahadeva temple and vishwanath temple appear as if they are shaped like rising mountain ranges. Clearly philosophy of Shiva's abode being kailasha temple is indicated through architecture. Or maybe it can be indicative of meru parvat one of the most sacred sites in Hinduism. The largest jaina temple is of Parshvnath temples have shown great variation both in styles Shape and faith.Pic ‚Äî vishwanath templePic - Kandariya mahadeva temple However other temples are relatively simple in designPic‚Äî vamana templePic ‚Äî Chaturbhuj templePic ‚Äî Parshavnath Temple Some sculptures indicate religious life gods daily lives of people their profession royal procession animals and human figures.    Overall the entire architecture is breathtaking and an epitome of Indian architecture and art style. The 4 goals in Hindu life dharma artha kama and moksha beautifully and thematically integrate with this architecture. It appears as if the artist builders and palnners are making a conversation with anyone who come in contact with these temples.

In the olden days the main sanctum was constructed on chosen geographic locations with higher cosmic energy which would be surrounded by the large temples and common to many villages. The temple structures were huge enough to accommodate hundreds of people inside and they could walk around freely. There is so much to explain but I shall keep it short with few important information: 1. Temples were built in the precise location to channel that cosmic energy to all who entered the temple. (This you can feel in the old temples). 2. Temple tower (gopuram) is pyramid shaped and directly above the sanctum which is topped by several metals this is in particular to absorb and harness the energy from the sun and the cosmos. Now the sanctum itself wouldn't have any windows or additional doors that might let the energy escape. The only way out is through the pravesha dwara (main door) where the disciples have to gather. This ensures that the positive energy be felt by everyone gathered.Image source: google 3. These temples have many herbal plants and trees and it is religiously believed that circling these trees is very beneficial. The real reason for this practice is that just by walking around the trees breathing fresh air would keep the our immune system strong against many diseases. 4. The god idols are sculpted from specifically selected stones and metals which again contains many traces of minerals which is believed to store the cosmic energy like a battery. These idols are further enriched with many offering such as curd honey milk sugar rose water sandalwood and many more items by performing Abhishekam. All these offerings are given to devotees in one or the other form. Sometimes as Prasadam or sometimes are paste which is generally applied on forehead. The Prasadam helped many poor people in the surrounding villages with nutrition fulfillment who may not even afford all the elements offered.Image source: google 5. Many old Large Temples served as treasure houses for the kings and also had underground tunnel system so in case of danger the King could flee through these secret underground tunnels to a safer place. 6. Many of the offerings like Theertham or Holy water in the temple are generally filled with herbs which protected the devotees with general health. 7. Indians generally walk around their homes barefoot this is especially emphasized in and around the mandir viz. the temple. This is practiced ideally to keep off the germs and mud carried by the dirty shoes at bay. It is also because the nerve endings at one's foot are massaged and acts as a great acupressure when we walk barefoot.Image source: google 8. Apart from all these scientific perspective temples were looked at more as a place where one can let go of his daily ordeals and find peace. The channeled positive energy reciting of shlokas grounds us down and we will be able to concentrate better.

The temples are famous for their elaborate carvings and sculptures which depict a variety of themes including spiritual and mythological figures as well as everyday life and activities. The temples are also known for their depiction of erotic scenes which have made them a popular tourist attraction. There are several theories about why the temples were built but it is generally believed that they were constructed as a celebration of life and as a tribute to the gods. The temples may have also served as a hub for cultural and artistic activities and as a place for learning and spiritual contemplation. The Khajuraho temples are considered to be unique and significant for several reasons. Firstly they are known for their elaborate and intricate carvings and sculptures which depict a wide range of themes and subjects including spiritual and mythological figures as well as everyday life and activities. The temples also have a large number of erotic sculptures which are considered to be an important part of the temple's artistic heritage. Secondly the Khajuraho temples are significant because they are a rare example of a temple complex that was built by a Hindu dynasty in medieval India. Most Hindu temples from this period were built in the south of India and the Khajuraho temples are one of the few examples of Hindu temples from this period in central India. Finally the Khajuraho temples are significant because they are a testament to the cultural and artistic achievements of the Chandela dynasty who ruled over the region during the 9th to the 13th centuries. The temples are a valuable source of information about the art culture and society of this period in Indian history.

There are 51 Shakti Peetas across the country. The goddess residing place in Kanchi is called as ‚ÄúNabisthana Ottiyana Peetam‚Äù. The Goddess is called as ‚ÄúSri Kamakshi. The word is derived from the heritage ‚ÄúKa‚Äù means Goddess Saraswati (God of Education) ‚ÄúMa‚Äù means Goddess Lakshmi (God of Wealth) ‚ÄúAkshi‚Äù means Eye. The name as a whole refers as the god lives in Kanchi with Goddess Saraswati and Goddess Lakshmi as her both eyes. The Lalitha Sahasranama poem is an idle example for the goddess power. ‚ÄúSachamara Ramavani Savya Dakshina Sevitha‚Äù Kanchi is also called as Satyavrita Kshetra . The Goddess worshipped Lord Siva by creating a mud idol in Kanchi. At that moment Lord Siva incarnated as Kamba River with high tides to test the worship of the goddess the goddess grasped the idol closely with her two hands from eroding in the tides. This prevented the idol from getting eroded in the floods. The goddess also performed Pooja by sitting in a needle tip surrounded by ‚ÄúPanchakagni‚Äù (surrounded by 5 fires) to free herself from the interest of livelihood. The Lord Shiva became happy gestured before her and married the goddess. Though there are many Shiva temples in the city the only temple to have the sanctorum of the goddess is 'SRI KAMAKSHI AMMAN TEMPLE‚Äô. There are also eight other Shakti goddesses surrounding the temple. The place where goddess resides is ‚ÄúGayatri Mandapam‚Äù. The Goddess lives in temple in 3 forms. They are Sri Kamakshi Sri Bilahasam and Sri Chakram. The goddess is in a sitting posture of ‚ÄúPadmasana‚Äù .The goddess contains Pasa Angusa Pushpabana and Sugarcane in her forehands. The Goddess Mahalakshmi was given curse by the Lord Vishnu to incarnate as Aarupam form. The Goddess Mahalakshmi comes to Kanchipuram and performs the worship chanting in the name of Lord Vishnu to free her from this Aarupam. After long prayers the Goddess is freed from her Aarupam and given a Rupam by the Lord Vishnu. There exists a belief that Goddess kamakshi kumkum has to be offered to the idol of Aarupa Lakshmi within the sanctorum where by the goddess Lakshmi will fulfil your needs on the prayer. The temple sanctorum consists of a deity ‚ÄúAdivaraha Perumal‚Äù which is one of the 108 Vaishnaivaite deity worship temple. The history reveals us that King Dasaratha performed ‚ÄúPutra Kameshi Yagam‚Äù in the temple for the Birth of a child to his kingdom. The King performed pooja to the ‚ÄúNabisthanam‚Äù of the goddess in the temple. The King Dasaratha within a few months received a child. The King Dasasratha belongs to the ‚ÄúEkshuvagu Vamsam‚Äù where by the prime deity is Goddess Kamakshi. The extract of this story is visible in ‚ÄúMarkendeya Puranam‚Äù. The faith is if prayed truly the goddess provides child for the childless couples. The Saint Adisankara born at Kaladi in Kerala travelled across all the parts of the country. When he visited Kanchipuram he felt the goddess is in a ferocious mode that the entire sanctorum was very hot. So to personify her and accomplish to her to normal state the saint sung songs in the praise of goddess named ‚ÄúSoundarya Lahari‚Äù then he established a Sri Chakra in front of her idol to keep her cool and personified. This srichakram is visible to all of us and all the poojas are done to srichakram too. The Saint established Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam and attained Sarvagyna peetam in this holy city. The temple was visited by a dumb devotee named ‚ÄúMookan‚Äù. The devotee begged the goddess to free him from this dumbness so that he can perform poems on the praise of the goddess. The goddess suddenly provides him grace by freeing him from dumbness and giving him intellectuality in creating poetry. He was very happy with the goddess that he wrote a poetry named ‚ÄúMookapanchashati‚Äù in which he praises entirely about the grace of the goddess with her beauty. The temple goddess has been so graceful that she has made dumb to a poetist has given birth to the childless couples and provides wealth to all her devotees. The goddess destroys evil and helps the prosperity of goodness to prosper throughout the world. The special occasions for the Goddess Kamakshi are Navratri Bhramotsavam and Pournami (Full Moon Day). The goddess is distinctively powerful in these times and it is even more auspicious to visit the temple in these days. I wish all the devotees to participate in this special time and receive the blessings of the Goddess Kamakshi without fail.

It is located in the holy city of Kanchipuram in the state of Tamilnadu in South India.

Millions of devotees from all over the world visit the shrine to have a Darshan of the deity and obtain his blessings.

Lord Brahma is believed to have performed a yagna here along with his consorts Gayatri and Savitri.

They developed under the reign of the Rashtrakuta and Ganga dynasties. By the 8th-century the Hindu Nolambas ‚Äì also known as Nolamba-Pallavas ‚Äì were governing this region for the Rashtrakuta and Ganga dynasties. The reign of Mahendra I (860‚Äì895 CE) brought renewed powers and economic prosperity after he defeated the Banas. After the death of Mahendra I his mother Devalabbarasi came to power assisted by her second son Iriva-Nolamba. She was great patron of arts used the epithet Nolamba for her sons and she built the Nolamba-Narayanesvara temple. The style that emerged from these period (850‚Äì1000 CE) reflects a synthesis of regional Hindu arts and is now called the Nolambavadi style. Early 9th-century inscriptions found near Nandi village refer to a temple for Shiva. However these inscriptions do not mention this temple complex. According to the Archaeological Survey of India these inscriptions can be attributed to the Nolamba dynasty ruler Nolambadiraja and the Rashtrakuta emperor Govinda III and they date from c. 806 and 810 CE. Copper plate inscriptions found about 10 kilometers away near Chikkaballapur refer to the wife of Bana Vidhyadhara making a gift to the temple. These are indirect references as they do not specifically mention either of the two large twin temples. Based on architecture and iconography the Bhoganandiswara and the Arunachaleswara temples are dated to no later than the 10th-century and no earlier than the 9th-century. The temple was later under the patronage of successive notable South Indian dynasties and they have all contributed to the form that has survived into the modern era: the Ganga Dynasty the Hoysala Empire and the Vijayanagara Empire.

Unlike Islam rulers who used the sculptures for other purposes but that's not the case of Hindu Kings. Reinstalling Vigrahams or Murthies in some other place without destroying it is not considered as sin in Hinduism and even the plundered wealth of other kingdoms were used to construct the new temples! This has happened in many instances. Pallava Time Pallavas were ruling from Kanchi which is now in Tamil Nadu and Pallavas were one of the strongest ruling kingdoms of that time who were known for their temple architecture and the famous Kings.Vatapi Ganapathi( Badami as called now in Karnataka) which is in Tamil Nadu now  is believed to have been abducted from Vatapi and brought to the Tamil region by Paranjothi a general in the army of the enemy Pallava king during one of the many battles fought between Chalukya and Pallava armies in the 7th century CE.The icon is said to have been reinstalled in a small shrine in the Uthrapathisvaraswami temple complex in Tamil Nadu later the same Paranjyothi becomes as Nayanmar or a Shaiva Saint. The games Sanskrit sing ‚ÄúVatapi Ganapathim" is composed praising the same Ganapthi my Muthuswami Dikshitar who lived and composed several centuries later in 18th century. Now Narasimhavaraman in return constructs a Mallikarjuna temple at Vatapi with the same bounty to commemorate his victory and took the title ‚ÄòVatapi-Kondan‚Äô or ‚Äòtaker of Vatapi‚Äô. But some historians say this is myth  am not sure Rich slice of historyNow let's go to same Chalukya Time-Chalukyas of Badami Aihole near Badami has a Kailasanathar temple. This temple resembles the kailasanathar temple of Kanchi. After defeating Pallavas Vikramaditya Pulikesi took both his queens to Kanchipuram. They visited the Kailasanathar temple and wanted to construct a similar one in their town. The treasures from Kanchi were used to build the Kailasanathar temple of Aihole. There are also 2 temples names Lokeshwara temple and Trilokeshwara temple. Based on their wives names lokamadevi (Lokeshwara) and Trilokadevi(Trilokeshwara). One temple follows the Dravidian style vimana and the other one Nagara style vimana.Now let's visit the great Cholas. When Cholas defeated the Kadambas of Banavasi they brought few Sculptures from these places.In the sculpture of dwarabalagasan Inscriptions of rathathiraja was found. This shares a information that this dwarabalagas were taken from Karnataka after burning the city of Banavasi.These statues were placed in darasuram temple earlier but now they are tranfered to the art gallery tanjore.In one more instance. When Cholas( Raja Raja Chola) won over the Chalukyas they used the treasure money to construct the Great Peruvudaiyar Temlple of Tanjavur. It's also believed that the Shiva Lingam of Peruvidaiyar Temple is said to be brought from the Vemulavada Temple in the present Telangana region In turn what did the Cholas do they have constructed hundreds of temples in the present KarnatakaAndhra and Telangana. Read this answer to know more:-Gautham Sampath ¬∑ Oct 17What are the contributions of the cholas to Karnataka?Cholas have the habit of building temples wherever they go because they were hard core spiritual people who were continously engaging in religious activities and all. The even dig lakes in the regions they go and hence in their rule of the regions of than Karnataka they have built many temples and also have constructed many lakes in Karnataka especially in Southern Karnataka where they had ruled for a longer period of time( 987 to 1118CE) by overthrowing the western Gangas.  Bhoga Nandishwara TempleChikkabalapura They even contributed donations to the temples built by other Kings and they were patrons of Shaivism Most of these temple have been built during the time of Arulmozhi Varman aka Raja Raja Chola Rajendra Chola and Rajadhiraja Chola cause we get this information from the Tamil inscriptions that are found in the temples in Karnataka. Cholas are said to have left inscriptions by recording everything from place names to the contributions made in all the places they ruled unlike other kingdoms and this gives us a clear view on what all they did.  Pancha Lingeshwara TempleBegur. We can find Chola temple mainly in Southern Karnataka in districts such as Bangalore Urban rural Bangalore Ramanagara KolarMysore ChamrajanagarTumkurDakshina Kannada and in Mandya and they even created temple towns in Karnataka region just like in Tamil region. Actually much research isn't done on the Chola temples in Karnataka and I got many information shared by people in Facebook through the pages I follow rather than in Google.

Even the Madiwala lake is constructed during Chola era as per the inscription in the Madiwala Shiva Temple.  Mukthinateshwara Temple Binnamangala Nearly 100+ temples are there in Southern Karnataka which has been built Cholas in their brief period of rule which is really astonishing. Even in Northern Karnataka here and there we can Chola temples like below one.

RelatedDoes the phrase "this is not legal advice" magically make any legal advice not legal advice?,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-phrase-this-is-not-legal-advice-magically-make-any-legal-advice-not-legal-advice,,I will explain why I use such disclaimers. The point is not whether it actually is legal advice - the point is avoiding any possibility of creating an unintended attorney-client relationship and any liability that might come along with that relationship. In late September I will be on a panel discussing Social Media for Lawyers at the annual conference of the State Bar of California. The following is taken from one of my handouts: Avoiding the Accidental Client I don't want anyone who reads a post to believe that we have created an attorney-client relationship or that s/he can rely on information in the post as legal advice. To some extent my concern is fairly obvious and broadly shared but there also is a practical basis: My professional liability insurance application asks each year whether I send non-engagement letters when declining representation. In effect I want to decline representation preemptively when posting on social media. (Of course ultimately I want readers of my posts to become clients but that process will happen after I restate the disclaimer in my reply to the prospect‚Äôs first e-mail inquiry and when appropriate send out an engagement letter.) Each of my posts on LinkedIn Avvo and other third-party sites that has legal content includes the following notice:  Disclaimer: This post does not constitute legal advice and does not establish an attorney-client relationship. On my blog I use a slightly longer notice:  This blog does not provide legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship. If you need legal advice please contact an attorney directly. I include the second sentence in this longer form to be more helpful (and less abrupt) and to plant the idea that the reader can contact me (or any other attorney). I include this notice on every page of the blog and at the end of every post. That probably is overkill (I suspect that once on each page suffices) but the belt-and-suspenders approach makes me feel more comfortable. Please note that Avvo (the only legal-specific site in which I routinely participate) provides help in this regard.

The temple was built from 685-705 AD by a Rajasimha ruler of the Pallava Dynasty. It is one of the earliest structural temples and the largest one built by the Pallavas.It is of stone-built architecture unlike the rock-cut architecture built into hallowed caves or carved into rock outcrops as in Mahabalipuram. The tall gopuram (tower) is to the left and the temple complex is to the right. The temple's foundations are made of granite which could withstand the weight of the temple while the superstructure including the carvings are all made of sandstone.Facts About Kanchi Kailasanathar TempleThe most famous Brihadeshwara Temple in Thanjavur is inspired by Kailasanathar Temple.A passage is there inside the shrine.

The first form is immobile and is the main deity. The second are the small festive forms which can be moved about and are the ones paraded around town in chariots. The Dhruva Bera cannot be moved. The Visarjan mantra involves shifting the deity as part of the process of asking the deity to vacate the idol. After this the idol is understood to be devoid of the divine principle. Some temples who must transport Utsava Vigrahas for example to another city perform the Shayan ceremony to put the deity to sleep and then transport them in that state. It's possible this could be done for a Dhruva Bera but I am unsure. The only alternative (and the least desirable) is to perform Visarjan shift the idol and then perform Prana Pratishta again. However I have never encountered an example where Prana Pratishta is performed on the same deity after the Visarjan mantra has been used.

I know why the government is quite eager to pass or handover the temple responsibilities to the HindusI think it's due to the conversions or diversion of Temple funds and encroachment of temple lands that is already happening in other South Indian states. For instance Tamil Nadu (encroachment of land) Andhra Pradesh (some of the management staff of Tirupati shrine are Christians and there are conversions happening in the Temple's premisesnoI'm not saying thisbut the Andhra Pradesh ministry person himself) and Kerala(Crores of rupees taken as covid funds from Guruvayoor Shrine). The government fears the same. What court said:Hindu religion has never been so narrowI mean they(the court)tried to explain the flexibility of the Hindu religion. What I personally know:a few Hindu temples in Karnataka especially in Dakshina and Uttara Kannada region are managed completely by Jains of Karnataka who are Tuluvas and Kannadigas among themselves. The best example is Shri Dharamasthala Manjunatheshwara Shrinewhich is completely managed by the Jains of that particular region without a single controversy ever happened. What I can deduce:court is absolutely rightbut also is unable to separate the religion from the statewhen people ask for rightscourt can't give the reason of religion ‚Äúalone‚Äù. This exactly is what J Sai Deepak saysthat how can the verdict (I don't want to criticize it because I do consider the supreme verdict of any court as supreme) speak for the religion regarding the religion rather than the people or community or group asking for rights. One best example: suppose a hypo conditionwhere there are some Quakers or any other religious groupswhen they ask for the court to direct their rightsthe court ‚Äúcan't" blame the religion. If it doesthen what kind of secularism is this which doesn't separate the state and religion and againall the other shrines of other religions are run by the members of respective community. I acknowledge the Court's verdictbut I FAIL to understand this version of secularism.

Temple idol maintenance everyday costs power festival celebrations etc. are all possible with in this donations.

Show the same vigor to question them. That is how one can truly stay secular. Also why don‚Äôt these same people question maintaining the burial grounds of the erstwhile rulers? While temple is not getting much from public tax money these burial places are being maintained with the tax money and except for one or two there may not be any burial place (a monument for no reason) which is ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù!

[1] Kaaba was a holy site for Arabian Pagans and it hosted the idols of the pagan deities. The chief deity was Hubal - the moon god.After the invasion of Mecca Mohammad took over Kaaba and destroyed the idols present in the Kaaba. Since then it became a holy site for Muslims.Kaaba and Shivalinga rumour : The credit for linking Shivalinga with Arabs goes to Savarkar. In his book ‚ÄúSix glorious epochs of Indian history ‚Äú In paragraph 650 he claims Arabians worshipped Shivalinga. [2]Let‚Äôs not blame Savarkar entirely for the rumour. The rumour has a long history. The Islamic rumour about Somnath Lingam : In fact early Muslims thought that the Idol of Somnath Linga was the statue of Arabian pagan goddess. Romilla Thapar wrote : [3] ‚ÄúA major poet of the eastern Islamic world Farrukhi Sistani who claims that he accompanied Mahmud to Somanatha provides a fascinating explanation for the breaking of the idol. This explanation has been largely dismissed by modern historians as too fanciful but it has a significance for the assessment of iconoclasm. According to him the idol was not of a Hindu deity but of a pre-Islamic Arabian goddess. He tells us that the name Somnat (as it was often written in Persian) is actually Su-manat the place of Manat. We know from the Qur'an that Lat Uzza and Manat were the three pre-Islamic goddesses widely worshipped and the destruction of their shrines and images it was said had been ordered by the Prophet Mohammad. Al-lat Manat and Al-Uzza :Two were destroyed but Manat was believed to have been secreted away to Gujarat and installed in a place of worship. According to some descriptions Manat was an aniconic block of black stone so the form could be similar to a lingam. This story hovers over many of the Turko-Persian accounts some taking it seriously others being less emphatic and insisting instead that the icon was of a Hindu deity. THE identification of the Somanatha idol with that of Manat has little historical credibility. There is no evidence to suggest that the temple housed an image of Manat. Nevertheless the story is significant to the reconstruction of the aftermath of the event since it is closely tied to the kind of legitimation which was being projected for Mahmud.‚ÄùIt is interesting to note that early Muslims believed the rumour that Somnath Idol was that of Al-manat‚Äôs idol. While today‚Äôs far right Hindus believe Kaaba was a Shiva temple which hosted a Linga.Footnotes[1] Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia - Wikipedia[2] https://savarkar.org/en/pdfs/6_Glorious_Epochs_of_Indian_History.pdf[3] txt_thapar_somnath

So asking how are ‚ÄúHindu temples‚Äù different from Bauddha or Jaina temples is meaningless. After all Bauddha and Jaina are Hindu darsana with their own sampradaya. You could instead reword it to: How are Bauddha and Jaina temples different to the temples of the other sampradaya like Sikhi Shaiva Shakta Vaishnava and so on. You could say that there is no difference since all temples are a focal point for the community which they serve. And the purpose of all temples is to educate you ‚Äúabout yourself‚Äù and by inference your dharma! However there is an essential difference. Vaishnava temples for example educate the masses through a visual representation of the nature of reality with the sanctum containing the material representation or vigraha of the focal point of practices which is nothing but a ‚Äúhigher human ideal‚Äù that defines a path to the ultimate objective which is moksha. It also educates you on the other ideals and qualities (represented by other deities) essential to realizing your objective through mnemonic narratives (folklore) associated with the main deity. Bauddha and Jaina temples instead focus on educating scholars (monks) of their tradition on the teachings of the Buddha and the Jaina Tirthankaras and are hence usually part of a larger complex that houses the students and teachers. While the education in Vaishnava temples involves passive learning those in Bauddha and Jaina temples involve active learning. Active learning for scholars in the Vaishnava tradition happens only in a Gurukula.

,,It is possible to take legal action against a government department if you believe they have failed in their duty to maintain and preserve a public asset such as a Hindu temple. However before proceeding with legal action it may be beneficial to first raise your concerns with the department and give them an opportunity to address the issue.

It would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who is familiar with the laws and regulations in the state of Karnataka as the laws and procedures for taking legal action against government entities can vary by jurisdiction

Atma Shaktam / Nirvana Shaktam 1) I am not mind nor intellect nor ego nor the reflections of inner self (citta). I am not the five senses. I am beyond that. I am not the ether nor the earth nor the fire nor the wind (the five elements).

These are the three fundamental questions about life that I always thought of. I think the question who am I was the heaviest on my mind. Who am I what is this me? When someone calls my name I look back and think is this name me? What is it that defines me? My body changes over time and my mind changes like the tides as well. Even something that I was so sure about in the morning can change in the afternoon depending on circumstances. If you look at the sky clouds flow in the sky the clouds' shapes vary and clouds float in the wind. Everything in the world changes just as the sky changes. But is there something constant and eternal existence in the world? I was good at singing when I was very young like before elementary school. I was able to learn songs from the radio. When I listened only once or twice I could memorize the song lyrics. My family and neighbors around me complimented me for singing well. I enjoyed listening to talent shows on the radio especially when children sang. I wished I could join the competition and I envied the children who won the awards. I always told myself that I should have been that kid. I'm just a poor kid who sings well and I felt it was unfair that my parents couldn't support me to be a great singer. In school I was usually asked to sing in front of my classmates. And I used to sing in front of so many crowds whenever the school had special events. Many teachers and classmates told me that I should be on TV with such talent. Whenever I sang I was so happy and joyful and I felt like I was the best. As I grew up I wanted to take vocal lessons and study music more deeply. But I was the oldest child in a low-income family and I couldn't fulfill my dream. I didn't have a chance to get a proper music education.I had to give up my dream and I went to the regular high school. Around that time I worked hard at the church and there was a high school choir competition that other churches also participated in. I participated as a representative of our church and after school I went to church and practiced hard. There was a granddaughter of my pastor in the church. She was around my age and she was taking lessons to major in vocal music. She also participated in the same contest that I was joining. The day of the competition had come and all the participants had finished singing. Only the awards ceremony remained. I heard the third and second prize winners but my name was not there. My heart was beating so loud. I believed that there was no way that I would not get any award at all. I thought I was the winner. When they announced the final winner's name I got up and went forward without realizing it and I received the prize. I could not hear anything in my ears. When I came back to my seat I found that the final winner was not me but my pastor's granddaughter. I was so embarrassed for what I had done and kept on blaming myself for doing that. I couldn't leave the place until everyone else left for the shame. That night I cried all night long. What happened that night made me sad for a long time and filled with guilt and shame. That event remained in my subconscious for a long time. My head kept on screaming "why did I do that?" "How could you be such a fool?" I couldn't stop being upset with myself. I hated myself so much. When I got older one day I saw an excerpt from a book "People don't see what they see they see what they want to see. They listen to what they want to hear.‚Äù After seeing that I was able to understand why I did what I did. My ego and pride saying that I should always be better than others made me believe that I was in the 1st place. My body moved subconsciously to receive the award. The name I thought I heard was not real but my mind made a fake voice. I was terrified that what I saw heard felt and said could not be true but could be distorted information. What I created in my head could feel more real than reality. When I found out that it is an illusion that I have created I started to ask myself deep questions like: "What is my purpose in life?" "What is true and what is false?" People mistakenly believe that they are right. Two people can have different interpretations of the same thing even within the same space and time and I was like that. I wanted to find the answers to these questions. That time was the start of my quest for finding the true meaning of life.Among several attempts to find answers to my questions I finally found some light. My friend introduced me to meditation. Meditation was a way to reflect on me and let go of all the illusory minds to find out who I truly am. I wanted to find the answers to "Who I am?" "How good or bad I have lived?" After looking back on myself and clearing out the illusions I held in my mind I gradually found the answers. What I realized from the meditation is the following.Since I was born into this world I accumulated pictures of all my experiences. So I was not living in the real world but the world of those pictures.And I had lived holding regret and shame from the past. But after I let go of those pictures that were the cause of my shame I could forgive myself.Now I don't hold on to the past so I am always in the present. All my curiosity about myself and life has resolved entirely.All I have to do is focus on now and do my best in whatever I do.The more I abandoned the self that I hated so much the more I became free and happy. After the meditation session I could breathe more freely. Gradually I became a new person after I had realized that I had lived with misconceptions of who I was. I was so thankful; I became a person that is true and happy. While meditating the true me appeared and the false me disappeared. It became so clear that I had finally become my true self and could see that this true self is a never-changing and eternal existence. I shed tears of gratitude during meditation. Now the journey to find the true me is over; my quest has been accomplished. I wish everyone could feel the same appreciation that I got from throwing away the false self and finding the true self. Finally I would like to share this video clip and I think you will like it. Thank you for reading my answer. :)
RelatedHow should one ask the question "Who am I?"?,https://www.quora.com/How-should-one-ask-the-question-Who-am-I,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bd51a2939e48065c8c1ab0341d6b8425,I kind of have to fill in the blanks on your question for myself because it's a little bit like asking "what's the number for 911" in its current form right? I think that you're asking how one goes about understanding who they are -- which is a lot harder than just saying the words "who am I?". I think it helps if you have "tools" for dealing with this inquiry -- ideas that can help you slice-and-dice as you study the question.   Meditation is an example of a tool for self-inquiry: you sit there alertly without distractions trying to observe the activity of your own mind.   There's lots of other tools too I'm not going to offer a whole inventory here. But I will say something about the general spirit of the process that I favor.   I consider that the most powerful approach to self-inquiry is to presume that you are hunting for lies:  falsehoods that you tell yourself about yourself or life.   The reason to make "find the lies" a priority is because your ego is doing its best to prevent that from happening.   So if you want to understand the truth about yourself you sort of have to push in the opposite direction:  assume that your thoughts are a bunch of falsehoods and see if you can figure out precisely in what ways you are misleading yourself. In that process if you come across something that is really true of course that's wonderful.   But I think most people who try this find far more self-deception than gems of perfection.    That is really very good news because nothing really starts to move until the untruths get exposed.

We are born ignorant and gradually become aware of our body. This is obviously us at a young age and others are obviously their bodies. As we grow we appreciate our mind‚Äôs existence but it‚Äôs just a part of us along with the body. Even most leading scientists in this field generally tend to think like this so why should we disagree? Over the ages philosophers have tried to go deeper. Descartes said the well-known phrase ‚ÄúI think therefore I am.‚Äù He was trying to establish what was real and his thought was that because he can think he can be sure that he exists. He could have said ‚ÄúI think therefore I think I am.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI think therefore something thinks it is.‚Äù But he didn‚Äôt at least not on record. But still knowing that something thinks (in Descartes‚Äô analysis himself) doesn‚Äôt answer the question of who is doing the thinking. It‚Äôs accepted science now that our body changes continuously and over time completely. If we are our body this is a problem because we know we were present as young child and we still are now but our child‚Äôs body isn‚Äôt. So it‚Äôs impossible that we are the mass of material molecules that make up a body. They‚Äôve gone we haven‚Äôt. If that‚Äôs out as a possibility then the next level up is the mind. ‚ÄúI am mind‚Äù is a possible answer to who am I? But then what is a mind? We can change our mind and still be the same person. We always think of having a mind not being a mind. My mind is made up. I‚Äôve changed my mind. It went right out of my mind. Clearly our mind is integral to us but it‚Äôs ours not us. It‚Äôs something we use it‚Äôs something we can control (or not). What does it mean to say ‚ÄúI was in two minds‚Ä¶?‚Äù It means we were considering two options. Our mind was saying two different things. This one or that one? Should I do this or that? It‚Äôs something everyone experiences. Well maybe not psychopaths not sure how it works for them but for everyone else we have all had the experience of choosing between options. We do it everyday constantly. So if the mind is throwing up the options who is doing the deciding? Maybe the mind becomes fractured with each part assuming an identity and arguing it‚Äôs case among the other parts and then a consensus is reached? But a mind is not a gross physical object can it be divided? Does a person split into multiple people when faced with multiple options and then recombine into the original person again having resolved it? Does one part of the mind stay as the ‚Äòmother mind‚Äô while the kids argue over what to do? It sounds strange and unlikely. And then it gets more complicated when the intelligence is added. Intelligence definitely has a voice when we are deciding issues. The intelligence tries to be rational not swayed by the mind. Often the mind says what we want to do and the intelligence counters with what we should do. Calm and dispassionate the intelligence tries to present the logical rational ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô choice. It‚Äôs often in conflict with the mind. Our we the mind or are we the intelligence? Again who is deciding between the two ‚Äòvoices‚Äô? We are led to believe all this is going on in our brain. Brilliant and complex as the brain is it‚Äôs still a lump of matter. Matter doesn‚Äôt have intelligence and doesn‚Äôt have a mind. These are not qualities of matter. No chunk of matter can be tested in a lab and demonstrated to have either intelligence or a mind. We can electrify it bombard it with particles subject it to waves of electronic signals and any other waves that are handy but it will never display intelligence or a mind. It remains what it is a chunk of unintelligent mindless matter. Ah some say mind and intelligence are emergent qualities of matter. Millions of neurons linked together in the circuits of the brain manifest consciousness mind intelligence emotions etc. This is silly. Matter has no trace of these qualities anywhere in it. (Did you ever meet a happy brick)? Neurons don‚Äôt either. Electrically excitable cells don‚Äôt actually get excited. It‚Äôs a way of describing the change in membrane potential that is necessary for cellular responses in various tissues. They aren‚Äôt really excited about it and they don‚Äôt have intelligence and don‚Äôt have minds. Nor do brains. To propose that electrical impulses run through matter magically manifests intelligence and minds what to speak of consciousness is nonsense. This is not like creating a magnetic or electric field around an object it‚Äôs something totally new and totally absent in it‚Äôs origin - matter. The ever increasing sophistication of computers confuses people sometimes. Artificial intelligence and smart phones give the impression that they are similar to us but just not so upgraded. They are not. We are conscious and no computer or phone now or in the future will ever be conscious despite a thousand science fiction movies presenting the opposite. Yes yes I know sophisticated devices can mimic human functions and responses they appear to make decisions in response to stimuli and initiate actions just like a human being but they are never aware that they are doing it. They have no idea what they are doing because they are not alive. Only living things know what they are doing (and then only some of the time). This issue has wasted an incredible amount of time and energy. There seems no end to the speculation and theorizing. Emergentism idealism eliminative materialism identity theories neutral monism panpsychism substance dualism property dualism mental causation vitalism type physicalism also known as reductive materialism type identity theory mind‚Äìbrain identity theory and Lord knows what else. The matter was settle 5000 years ago by the master of all scientists Sri Krishna.Earth water fire air ether mind intelligence and false ego -- all together these eight constitute My separated material energies. Bg 7.4 Besides these O mighty-armed Arjuna there is another superior energy of Mine which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material inferior nature. Bg 7.5There. We are superior energy - not matter which is inferior. Why are we superior? Because we are alive. It‚Äôs hard not to feel superior to a dead body. We have bodies made of material elements which includes subtle matter like mind and intelligence. These form the bodies gross and subtle and we are the occupants. We use the material ingredients of the bodies to perform activities and experience the world. Problem solved. This is who I am. A part of superior energy of Krishna living in a material body. So simple if only everyone was allowed to listen to the Master Scientist instead of the present day Masters of science.

The who of a person can be reduced to a view of two parts: a purely factual who and the personal who of self-chosen identity. As a factual who we are human male or female tall or short. We tend to have certain emotional profiles such as jealous anxious laid back dramatic etc. Then we half our self-chosen identity the us we say we are the us we feel truly means something. The why of our self-chosen identity seems to be primarily because it speaks to us. It holds meaning. It's not like a family you are just born into without choice it's a carefully honed finely selected declaration of self. Not everyone is expected to have a well-define concept of self-chosen identity but in those who do the why of the particular choice is generally based in personal significance. It tends to be deeper than simply "I like that" going so far as to explain why one would be about this thing that they like. The why of our factual selves tends to be highly arbitrary. The country you were born in the color of your eyes these things were set in stone in a particular moment like so many dice rolled out onto a table to finally rest on one particular number. The why of our factual selves is similar to the why of how come some days you wake up and your hair is all messy but on other days it looks perfectly orderly right out of bed? But it can seem to get deeper. Why are some people jealous and others are not? Or why do some people seem to be more emotionally needy. I tend to find that so often these sort of factual selves are the result of incidentals. A person who happens to be born to a broken home may develop a lot of perspectives about that world due to that experience. To me in general asking why about the whole factual self is similar to asking why do I have a birthmark right there and why is it in that shape? It may have a very complex answer but often it's easily seen as arbitrary and devoid of deeper meaning. Now I want to delve a bit deeper into the concept of happenstance versus meaning-driven. Imagine the you that existed well before this life before this planet. Far enough back you had no hair no pinkeys no nostrils. You'd never yet tasted an anything be it good or bad. Your life is now filled with particulars and you all generally do have pinkeys and nostrils and your life is filled with things and experiences. It is possible for a life to come to mean so much to you that you begin to wonder what would have happened if you hadn't stumbled into it? It gets to the point where if you hadn't have been born in this place with this name to this family and met this group of people it's as though you would just be less. I say that the particulars are happenstance. That fundamentally the self-chosen self has a base drive to seek out worthwhile experiences because the alternative simply isn't worth it. Pretty cut and dry mechanical perhaps but sensical on top of it. The result from such a drive in our case was the acquisition of ways in which to experience that -- but these ways are arbitrary. If you take two people who have great passions one for wrestling and one for oil paintings you are likely to find that they are equally as fulfilled in their pursuit of these things (even if one of them happens to be ~safer~). In terms of happiness then a case can be made that it is not the particular hobby they stumble upon that specifically matters but instead the purpose it fulfills. This is also why I expect that if you were to catalog the self-chosen image of many people you would get a lot more general descriptions such as "I am a passionate person" or "I like to be engaged" or "Relationships matter to me" than you are to find specifics because the great majority of the time a specific can be swapped for some other specific and achieve what you were looking for just as well. The whole subject comes up for me when I see myself start to identify with the specifics and wonder about the alternatives. So far I always find that the specifics weren't the essential part. I hope my answer does relate to your question: why you end up you. Every question has an answer even if the answer is that the question is not applicable so keep seeking your answers. When I was 4 years old or younger one of the first questions I asked my mom was "Mom I understand that you exist and you had a kid that makes sense to me but why am I this one?" I wanted to know why of all the people on the planet I was literally seeing through the eyes of just this one being the kid she had. I mean can't she have a kid and me not be that one? I often find that if you strip all of existence down to a single dreaming being who exists before all things they experience you'll arrive at answers much more easily.

All those answers have to be rejected: NETI NETI - one has to go on saying "Neither this nor that." When you have denied all the possible answers that the mind can supply and devise when the question remains absolutely unanswerable a miracle happens: suddenly the question also disappears. When all the answers have been rejected the question has no props no supports inside to stand on any more. It simply flops it collapses it disappears.

Thus the purpose is not to find an intellectual answer which can never satisfy myself but to cultivate actual awareness of I. My basic error - this applies to all humans until they awaken - is taking my body and mind to be I. This is what the dictionary means by self-awareness: Certain objects in my experience such as certain thoughts feelings this body and mind are taken as I who am reading this. ‚ÄúWho am I" focuses awareness on I (subject) instead. Thus my attention is withdrawn from what I mistakenly take to be I.

This is neither subject nor object but Self is all there is! If you understand you don't have to repeat ‚Äúwho am I?‚Äù.

Did you ever notice how freely people post extremely helpful websites? Years ago when the web was first created I wanted some lyrics from Disney songs.  I was amazed to learn that someone had gone to the trouble of posting them for free.  It had been a lot of work. Why did they bother? I began to realize that the web offered a new venue for a natural human spirit of generosity of sharing. People love to help others. It is a very deep instinct and probably more responsible for our civilization than is generally recognized.  We gain pleasure when we do it. Wikipedia is also such a miracle. It is amazing how good a job it does. I grew up with the Encyclopedia Brittanica and Wikipedia goes so far beyond it that it is amazing.  Many people contribute to improving the Wikipedia web sites just out of the pleasure they get in doing a good thing in helping to create something so well-done. Jimmy Wales should be given a Nobel Peace Prize. Quora in my mind is the latest discovery of a method to extend this instinct to help others. I am addicted. If I have the right answer to a question I really enjoy sharing it. Unlike email Quora shares the questions and answers with thousands of other people. In fact many people don't even realize that they have a question until they see someone else posting it.

Set a timer for 10 minutes and GO! You'll be surprised at what pops out. As far as why you are are here and why you have to die... you are here because of your parents. That's it. Do with it what you would like. There's no deep meaning as far as I can tell. I'm just one of billions that have lived and so are you.  You have to die because that's what happens. It's a good thing too. Think of how monotonous even the funnest thing would become if we lived forever. It would suck. Even food would be boring. Heck after almost 40 years of eating I'm almost sick of food already! Also the population of every animal that never died would be absolutely nuts. We'd be immortal crowded and in misery. Be absolutely thankful for death.  Overall we're humans. You're a mammal; an ape with no fur. You think and feel because your brain is a highly evolved organ that ended up thinking and feeling so that you could survive.  So after you read your answers go stand naked in front of the mirror and examine every part of you. You are ordinary but also extraordinary at the same time. Imagine your skeleton muscles and circulatory system too. Might as well not stop at what you can see on the outside. Enjoy every part of you. Then go about your day. Make it a good one!

If we can't know those things we can't have a proper answer to define who we really are. We only know our names and a little bit about ourselves not our whole story sorry. So since there is no one to answer at least for now I am going to ask this question again even though I can't have a reply.

How do you know?How do you know that you yourself exist? I know because not only I think I am but also I feel so with all my senses. But I can‚Äôt say the same of God. You‚Äôll say the same of God if you follow closely what I‚Äôm going to say. Okay? I‚Äôd love to. Please go ahead.Well what you‚Äôve just told me is from the knowledge derived from the experience of your waking state. So what? What you‚Äôre going to say is also being said in the waking state you and I are sharing.Well I‚Äôm coming to that. Suppose you dream the same situation as this when you go to sleep tonight.  Don‚Äôt you feel it real as long as you‚Äôre in that dream state? Yes absolutely. But the moment I wake up I feel it unreal. Further the experience of seeing and conversing with you in my dream is my own. You won‚Äôt have any knowledge of it until I reveal it to you myself. It‚Äôs so because the dream is my own personalized experience. But I can recollect and re-live it and can report it to you in this waking state which we share.You‚Äôre right. You‚Äôre making things easier for me. You‚Äôre unwittingly anticipating what I‚Äôm going to say. It helps me to explain with ease the advaitin‚Äôsposition to an analytical thinker like you. Go ahead Sir. I can‚Äôt wait to listen to your explaining. I‚Äôm very very eager to hear you out.You go to sleep and dream daily. In fact we don‚Äôt remember most of our dreams though they make up most of our sleep. We go through a deep sleep state when we aren‚Äôt dreaming in our sleep. This is everybody‚Äôs daily experience. Did you ever think of what happens to you when you go through this deep sleep state that is the dreamless state? I never thought of it. May be I think my ‚ÄòI-ness‚Äô is under suspension only to restore itself in the dream state and again in the waking state.You‚Äôre partially correct. The ‚ÄòI-ness‚Äô you experience in the waking state is different from the ‚ÄòI-ness‚Äô you experience in the dream state. In your dreams your ‚ÄòI‚Äô is capable of creating a world consisting of animate beings as well as inanimate things which are very much like in the real world. The fun of it is you feel apart from this fantastic world though you yourself have created it. Of course it isn‚Äôt your conscious creation. It is your sub-conscious projection or rather your unconscious creation in your dream state. That‚Äôs why you feel apart and don‚Äôt know what goes in the minds of others in your dream though the dream is your creation. The moment you wake up your waking-state ‚ÄòI-ness‚Äô promptly returns. You get me? I get you. That too with all the implications. In fact I‚Äôm tempted to doubt if my ‚ÄòI-ness‚Äô in the waking state is a constant. For this one ‚ÄòI‚Äô of me becomes variable many in my dreams. And again this ‚Äòuni-I‚Äô of my waking state and the ‚Äòmulti-I‚Äô of my dream world becomes simply ‚ÄòI-less‚Äô in the deep sleep state. I wouldn‚Äôt have any recollection of my ‚ÄòI-ness‚Äô in the dreamless state. I assume that there would be no awareness of ‚ÄòI‚Äô in that state. I wonder where would this ‚ÄòI‚Äô be in that state. But it must be there in the background only to be restored every time my waking state returns.Again you‚Äôre partially correct.  According to advaita it‚Äôs the other way round. In addition to the three states that is the waking the dream and the deep sleep states known to all of us there is a fourth state known to the great sages alone. This is a state where one is conscious only of the infinite non-duality like the singularity beyond space time and causation posited by the theoretical physicists. Being a doctoral student of physics you must be able to appreciate this. Well this singularity of physics is the non-duality of advaita. This manifest mutli-verse is from the unmanifest singularity. Similarly this manifest universe is from the unmanifest Brahman. In fact advaita says that the universe is only apparent while the Brahman is absolute. From the advaitin‚Äôs viewpoint the universe is only maya or illusion. But from the ignorant person‚Äôs viewpoint the universe cannot be simply wished away and therefore is real. Sir I can intellectually visualize this. If I can once experience that infinite non-duality I can perceive all the other states as illusory and insubstantial. I guess I can view the waking state too as a conscious dream with a perfect equanimity. Perhaps that is like being what is called a Jivanmukta the living-liberated. After my prarabdha is spent out I‚Äôll gain my moksha that is absolute liberation from all illusory dualities of space time and causation. In the ultimate analysis God is no extra-cosmic genius. God is one-without-a-second. That is the infinite Brahman. As the Upanishadshave it ahambrahmasmi: I am God where ‚ÄòI‚Äô is meant as the only real and infinite ‚ÄòI‚Äô behind the countless false finite ‚ÄòI‚Äôs and ‚Äònon-I‚Äôs of the macro-and micro-worlds. All the same one doubt bugs me.What is it? Can‚Äôt this infinity-experience after all be a glorious hallucination?First you‚Äôve to accept it in good faith until you become competent to judge it. Take for instance the dream experience. As long as you dream your dream experience is as good and authentic as your waking experience. When you wake up you realize that it is a dream. You become competent to judge only when you wake up. Similarly when you experience samadhi or the infinity-state you attain the competency to judge the insubstantiality of the other states. Until then you have no right to doubt the Samadhi as hallucination or self-hypnotism. Until then Ramana Maharshi‚Äôs inquiry of Who Am I is the best prescription for self-realization for those with an exceptional IQ(Viveka) and EQ(Vairagya). For others there are a number of disciplines in the sanatanadharma to suit their vastly varying tendencies or samskaras. For everyone is potentially divine in the precise sense of the word.##

In theory to really and completely experience your creativity you would like to divide yourself into the various animals people and even plants in that game and enter in that game and fully experience what you had just created through various viewpoints of many different living things in that game. But the main condition would be that those creatures should never know that I or "they" are the ones who originally created that world/game. Because that will surely spoil the whole experience of exploring that game world on their own not knowing what is there behind that corner or the secrets of the world that the developer hid in that game. But as days passed by those people in the game started becoming depressed. They started asking themselves "What the hell is this? What are we doing here? What is our purpose? WHO ARE WE? " But sadly they couldn't do anything about those questions because they were doing exactly what the developer had intended. They were EXPERIENCING THE GAME.

Also there is both reason and rhyme to the way you feel it is you your self trying to find a deeper meaning in your life and existence.  I found my answers owing to the pain that these emotions caused me  i found my answers in advaita vedanta and mostly philosophical insights to life. I do not think any other schools of thought are capable of answering these questions as it made sense to me. For now i advice you be like a pebble in the river and flow with the water to where so ever it leads.  It will lead you to your ocean ( That's a very poor metaphor i suppose) .

The first is what Daniel Montano said: your name son of x father of y your occupation how tall you are etc. It is an endless list and actually can be kind of self-affirming to realize how many things you are. The second which is what first comes to mind to me is you already know. You're just probably stuck in that the first answer is the only one your resume as it were. You know who you are it's who you're talking to when you talk to yourself the person who thinks "I'm hungry" or "she's cute" who feels sad or comfortable after a long day just lying down and watching some TV. It's the same you you've always been - that person inside "me" that you've had since your were born. You know that guy he's you. He's kinda vulnerable he gets mad sometimes he wonders "who am I?" but he knows hey I'm not such a bad guy. I'm trying right? People don't realize how great that person inside is. I don't know if you yourself would call the second a "real answer" but it is certainly one that's inarguable. It's for always you came with "me" you were there at your first memory right? Honestly my friend I know it's not so easy to give that aspect of yourself much credit. But it's really important to know that there's something far more than what you "do". Third answer might be that we're all here for some greater purpose a piece or an element in some big puzzle. Maybe we have no idea what that is but it's kinda a combination of the first two. If you're a parent don't you think that you're a pretty profound factor in your child's life story? And it's both what you do what you know your parenting skills AND that it's you involved. You're not just some random human unit with a kid. What makes you special in that regard and different from me or anybody else is that it's you that's the dad. That "you" is not only who you really are but it's who your child will most remember. Who knows maybe why we're all here is to be a part of each others' lives. Well... who are you? You're you. Who else could you be?

If you say you are a god in human form and if everyone treats you like a god in human form that is what you are.  If you say you are worthless and everyone agrees then that is what you are.

The five parts of the body which act‚Ä¶ and their functions‚Ä¶ are not 'I'. The five vital airs such as prana which perform the five vital functions such as respiration are not 'I'. Even the mind that thinks is not 'I'. In the state of deep sleep vishaya vasanas remain. Devoid of sensory knowledge and activity even this [state] is not 'I'. After negating all of the above as 'not I not I' the knowledge that alone remains is itself 'I'.

If you can differentiate between ‚ÄúI‚Äù & ‚ÄúMy‚Äù I think you can get the answer. Even though we are using these two words ‚ÄúI‚Äù & ‚ÄúMy‚Äù a number of times daily but generally we never go into the depth of its meaning. Most of the time we say ‚ÄúI am sitting‚Äù ‚ÄúI am eating‚Äù ‚ÄúI am writing‚Äù ‚ÄúI am . . .‚Äù ‚ÄúI am . . .‚Äù etc. and ‚Äúit is my car‚Äù ‚Äúmy office‚Äù ‚Äúmy hand‚Äù ‚Äúmy eyes‚Äù. So if we go deep in to the real concept of these two words ‚ÄúI‚Äù & ‚Äúmy‚Äù we understand that ‚ÄúI‚Äù means the Eternal Energy SOUL and ‚Äúmy‚Äù means the body and its relation to men materials situations qualities linked with the SOUL.

Life was simply a consequence of the fact that carbon is the most chemically fertile element due to it's ability to form so many versatile molecules. So thinking about it we're just one among the many probability distributions possible to add entropy to the surroundings we exist within. All you really are needed for is to transmit previous experiences and traits to your offspring. So if you think that way then every single being is and extension that arose from one ancientprimate and all of us all 7 billion of us is the same organism. Now existentially this question of 's no am I' arises from a human centric world ego. Once we realise that we don't really matter in the scheme of the universe other than to observe it's events and add more probability to certain events you'll see that the question slowly fades away Because we don't really matter so much. There are so many different perspectives from which you can speak on this matter but I think this explanation has somewhat of a stronger foundation than others.

As the iron box has its identity like manufacturerS.NoModel Nodate & place of manufacture you will be identified by your parentsplace of birthdate & time of birthyour name for identification.Just like each iron box has got its own specification people will have their own specifications by virtue of planetary positions at the time of birth.The life & durability of iron box is depending on the quality of materials & their characteristics as specified by the manufacturer.In the case of human beingslifequality & one's characteristics are specified by planetary positions at the time of birth.If the iron box is switched onits property of producing heat is identified.Similarlyif you were body is given life by Soul & Mindyour consciousness will be in action & all  feelingsemotionsangerthirst hungerpleasurepain etc will be felt.        Soul is part & parcel of Universe just like spark of fire is part & parcel of fire.Your breadth is part & parcel of air with separate identity as suggested by your name.The purpose for which we are born & our achievements & failures are based on how we perform in given circumstances  at given time as dictated by planetary positionswhich unveils our pastpresent & future.Our "Free Will" with  limitations set forth will determine our direction of movement to next evolution as plantsinsectsbirdsanimals or humans in next birth.Whether one believes  or notour rebirth after  death is imminent & cycle of birth & death continues for an infinite period unknown to us.Nothing in the Universe will get destroyed & physical objects get continuous changes & get transformed to some form or the other like waterwhich continues to be in different forms depending upon the situation it faces.In normal circumstanceswater remains as water but when evaporated it disappears but comes back as water vapor & when freezes  in cold temperature it becomes ice.All elements  in nature have their own cycles depending on the circumstances.Nature is a great repository of resources & we can tap our requirements with our ingenuity & expertise..This is how Science & Technology has given place to Hubble's Telescope & major inventions & discoveries in science & medicine.        Our relationship with the Universe is one of awe & surpriseunique & extraordinary compared to animals & other species which are less fortunate to have "Free Will" to live & exercise  their existence.

Illusions are the creations of the mind and they are not out there in reality. The brain conjures up the images in the brain. The Mirage in a desert is a typical example of an illusion.We have an experience of a self (I). This self this 'I' is an autonomous person with a cogent identity and sense of free will. But the experience is an illusion. The 'I' and the 'me' that define the self are in fact ever changing narratives generated by our brain to provide a cogent meaning to whatever is happening to us. The brain is actually generating the neural activation as if the illusory shape was really there - the brain is in fact hallucinating the experience.Similar ideas about the self can be found in Buddhism and the writings of Hume and Spinoza.

RelatedIs it really enough to just compare yourself with your previous self?,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-really-enough-to-just-compare-yourself-with-your-previous-self,https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bd51a2939e48065c8c1ab0341d6b8425,There's a big difference between comparing your results in some specific activity vs. thinking that you're comparing your "self". The basic concern with comparing yourself is that it feeds the machinery of ego maintenance which specializes in the nonsensical application of the logic that says "I am defined by some attribute that can be compared to others." So for example some people think that their value as a person comes from their wealth right?  "I am my money."    This is nonsense but it's very tempting because then it's fairly easy to figure out "who you are" -- just compare bank accounts with others. Same thing for your school marks -- if your assessment of your identity is entangled with your test scores then every time you come out at the low end of the spectrum you have an identity crisis. So people say "don't compare yourself with others" to solve that -- but it doesn't really solve anything because the whole notion that your identity is defined by things that can be compared is defective.   Trying to not compare yourself doesn't change that: if you believe that you're defined by these attributes you *will* compare them that is just the way the mind's ego maintenance processes work. The root of the problem is believing that you're an object which can be compared to others.   That belief gets fed by the ego competitions whether you win or lose.   It takes awareness and understanding to debunk that belief and then it takes courage to face the question that's left when you debunk it:  "who am I then?"

The central teaching of Advait Vedanta this bold and grand pronouncement declares that amidst all changes that occur in the universe there is something which remains changeless constant and ceaseless having no restriction from space time or causation. The essence of this one and only existent is referred to as Brahman and we are identifiable to it - We are that aware-conscious energy within our being-ness. Out of all the attributes of energy (Brahman) awareness is considered to be the highest (Parabrahman - Paramatma). We are a composite of body mind and soul within which the immortal spirit resides. Therefore the content of what we are is in the forms of body mind and consciousness and the context of ‚Äòwho we are‚Äô is that absolute eternal form of awareness which is responsible to make the soul mind and body conscious. The body and mind is our being in physicality the individual soul which contains the spirit is that beingness in abstract formless energy of who we are. Everything exists not because of our mechanical sense organs but simply because we are aware of what we see and hear. Meaning nothing can exist unless we are aware; from the stars to the subatomic particles. Awareness is present in the eternal now existing before and after every creation. And whatever we discover in this universe arises from our beingness which is awareness. Furthermore all that exists is not constant and is also changeable but the real self the absolute I-less state of beingness remains constant that which can neither be created nor destroyed and remains indivisible - Shanti Mantra/ Law of Conservation of Energy. Therefore the mind can access the being only through its being-ness confirming the doctrine of who we are. The body and mind is that becomingness of what we are and eventually what remains in that is-ness which reflects the absoluteness of what is really real as one and not two. - Om Tat Sat.

Your looks is your identity in common parlance. Since the shape of the body is constantly changing your finger prints are considered as your identity for serious business purposes. The cells that hold your finger prints are constantly changing! What does that tell us? The idea of the finger prints or the blue print for the finger prints as well as the entire body mechanism is coming from outside of the finger prints and the body mechanism! Where could this blue print be? Let us come back to this question but before we do that let us ask ourselves as to why children exhibit a personality from a very young age? We see child prodigies whose parents do not show any excellence. Children of the same parents exhibit diverse personalities. One child becomes a judge and another becomes a psychopath from the same family. Where does this personality come from? We have seen earlier that there is a blue print for the body mechanism that must exist outside of the body mechanism and now we see personality associated with the body mechanism that came from outside the body before its birth. All of this is clearly pointing to the fact that there is a very subtle mental body that is distinctly separate from the physical body mechanism and this mental body must be pervading the physical body mechanism. We know very well that the physical body mechanism is a constantly changing energetic movement. We also know that the personality is also subject to change by the influence of the immediate environment as well as the totality at large. It is therefore very clear that both the body mechanism as well as the personality are inert movements. There cannot be any fixed identity behind any constantly changing energetic movements. What does that say about your identity? Is there really any identity about you? When the body mechanism dies the subtle mental body of personality detaches itself from the physical body and attaches itself to a new suitable body in a new womb to express its tendencies all over again with a brand new temporal identity or ego! This phenomenon is called as rebirth and we have tons of anecdotal evidences for this phenomenon of rebirth. All of this clearly shows that there is no fixed identity free will or volition about the body or the personality. There is no ‚Äúyou‚Äù as a tangible entity with any semblance of identity free will or volition. There is a very mysterious metaphorical LIGHT that is called as consciousness and this LIGHT illuminates all of your perceptions namely seeing hearing smelling tasting feeling and thinking and this LIGHT does not recognize any subject/object division in any of our perceptions but IT includes the entire field of perception like a HOLOGRAM. By extension this LIGHT/HOLOGRAM includes the entire cosmos! The deep and strong feeling of ALIVENESS or EXISTENCE or BEING or the very core of our HEART is this metaphorical LIGHT called as consciousness that is universal and impersonal. This LIGHT does not belong to anybody but IT tis most intimate for all.

I you are a young person or even if you‚Äôre not listen up. A person is defined by their words and their actions. Most people when they introduce themselves say their name and what they do for a living. Your name is a given. It is either chosen by you or was chosen by your parents at your birth. What you do for a living is what you spend most of your time doing. My father often says (in so many words) that we are what we repeatedly do. This is reflected in one‚Äôs mentality and understanding of the world- the way they relate to the physical things in their life (for example an electrician has a completely different thought and action when they see a wire than a carpenter would) and also the way they relate to other people. In particular though the things we do most often- including our profession are reflected in our personal appearance- whether we have weight on how big we are which of our muscles are well defined whether we have a tan or not. if someone asks you who you are and asks for more information you might be inclined to cite a political ideology (left or right liberal or conservative) a favourite sports team a chosen hobby or other factors. In particular someone in a relationship might identify themselves as their partners girl or guy the mother or father to their children a provider or housewife. There‚Äôs a subset of people who became so passionate and obsessive about a hobby that it became what they do and that passion never leaves so when asked who they are they may call themselves an artist. It‚Äôs true of any profession though- there is an art in everything and the opportunity for excellence exists in anything you do. By the way my Name is Joshua and I‚Äôm a Poet Singer and Musician.

Some other girls said they had seen ghosts so we laughed and shrieked and had fun. When it was my turn I told my story: Back in middle school one day I got on the bus to go home after school. Suddenly I became severely ill and I was in terrible pain. I barely made it home in time to collapse on bed. I hadn‚Äôt even changed out of my school clothes. After some time passed I opened my eyes and I found that I was on the ceiling staring down at myself who was still passed out on my bed. It was an amazing experience because I felt no more pain and felt free because I was no longer in my body. I thought I could go anywhere like this. Then the thought occurred to me that if I remained separated from my body like this that maybe I would die. At that same instant I flew back into my body and woke up. When I told this story everybody shrieked and covered themselves in blankets all freaked out. Hahaha! That was the only time it ever happened and I went on to live my life thinking that this body was me. But what if there was an existence that could see hear feel and even think without this body? What if there was an existence that could live eternally because it‚Äôs not a material thing and what if that is my true self? Wouldn‚Äôt that be liberating?I wouldn‚Äôt be sick anymore because I‚Äôm not material anymore. Wouldn‚Äôt it be joyful to live like that? Even while this body still remains we would have no pain or burden if we knew this always-existing existence. With the mind of emptiness we could see and hear everything as it is. This existence is what we call the Truth and the true self is the self that has become one with the Truth. So far we have only heard of or spoken about this existence but there can be a time when we can become one with this existence and live. We think there‚Äôs a lot to do in this world and so we live busy lives but our first priority is to find our true self ‚Äì who am I? If we could live this way every moment of our lives would be filled with joy and happiness. I‚Äôd like to share a video that might help you on the journey to finding your true self:

My nature personality and life experiences have shaped me in numerous ways that will continue to shape me as I grow and evolve. When I reflect on myself and characterize myself I come up with various aspects of myself. These characteristics are words that can fully describe me. The characteristics that come to mind are honesty optimism and disciplined. I consider myself to be a very honest person. I have always been an honest person with myself and others. I never lie cheat or steal. I've been in situations where lying was the easy way out but I chose to be honest instead. For example there was this time when I accidentally left a store with an unpurchased candy bar. I could easily eat the stolen candy bar and move on with my life. After all it's only a few bucks and no one saw me take it. But I knew I hadn't paid for it so it didn't belong to me. Rather than taking the easy way out and eating the candy bar I returned to the store and paid for it. Although admitting my error was humiliating I knew the candy wasn't mine to eat. I am also a positive person. I am always upbeat and optimistic about the future. I usually work very hard and believe hard work is always rewarded. Regardless of the difficulties I have faced I have always chosen to believe that "there is always tomorrow." This optimism has allowed me to appreciate what I have while striving for more. I'm the type of person who considers glass to be "half-full" rather than "half-empty." Furthermore I find myself to be a much more disciplined individual. I always exhibit a controlled form of behavior in all of my actions. I believe that my disciplined personality has helped me understand the importance of doing the right thing at the right time allowing me to meet my goals. I believe that intelligence without discipline is useless; thus discipline is more important than intelligence. Discipline I believe defines a person for who he or she is: "discipline creates behaviors behaviors create routines and routines become who you are daily." januariswambua41@gmail.com academic researcher and writer.

Every one of the agonies in life are because of not knowing your actual personality. Until you understand your real essence you see yourself as by the name that has been given to you.2-So who are you? As a general rule you are a timeless soul. For endless lives the spirit was under the front of obliviousness. Along these lines we have been not able to encounter Oneself. With the finesse of the Gnani Purush we can now encounter our real essence through a logical investigation called Gyan Vidhi. From that point you won't just have a comprehension of the unadulterated soul yet in addition experience genuine satisfaction. 3-A vital looking man entered the air terminal. There was a long line at the registration counter. This man broke the line and went directly to the counter and began showing his identification and ticket. The lady dealing with the counter said - "Sir there is a line here if it's not too much trouble stand in line." He said - "No no I am in a rush I need to go." She said - "No kindly substitute line". Then at that point he said - "Do you have any idea about who I'm?" The lady promptly got the mike and said - "There is a man here who doesn't have any idea what his identity is might anybody at any point help him?" Nobody can help him since everybody is experiencing the same thing. Everybody is living here without knowing their real essence. Without knowing the fundamental things about it we are attempting to carry on with our life. All the disorder is a result of this. "Who am I?" - This question is the most strange inquiry of your life. On the off chance that you don't have the foggiest idea what your identity is do you know anything more without a doubt? On the off chance that you don't actually have the foggiest idea what your identity is can you know any person or thing? In the event that you don't have any idea who you are everything becomes one major joke. Then at that point the main comfort is that everybody is with you. This is the first and most significant thing that you ought to do in your life. As a matter of some importance it ought to be realized who is this (highlighting self) what is the idea of my reality?

A Tortoise is able to withdraw all its 6 organs into its shell. It is said that even human beings must be able to withdraw all their evil qualities while entering temple. Nandi IdolIt is said that Nandi is a symbol of strength as well as patience. Nandi is never seen standing or running in temples. It is always in sitting position. It says that even human beings must have strength to face any situation but they also have patience and calmness of Nandi. It is also said that Shiva meditates in the form of Nandi. Thus Nandi also represents Meditation. Why Hanuman is painted Red or Orange in temples?Once Hanuman saw Seeta who applied vermilion (sindhoor) on forehead and asked her the reason. Seeta said that she applied it so that Ram could have long and prosperous life. So Hanuman went and covered himself from head to toe in Sindhoor or Vermilion. He said ‚Äúif only a pinch of Sindhoor can do so much what will happen when I cover my entire body with Sindhoor‚Äù. Thus Hanuman is always painted Red in Temples. Importance of Shankh (Conch)Shankh is blown before the start of any Pooja especially Lakshmi pooja in temples (in some Homes). When Shankh is blown it releases sound similar to ‚ÄòOM‚Äô which is said to contain entire Universe. The frequencies or energy emitted releases positive energy suppressing negative energy in Body. It can also be seen that lord Vishnu blew Shankh at the start of Mahabharata. Thus it also symbolises Victory.Some people might also believe different theories/stories from above.

After the marriage Manohar who is a big devotee of Lord Venkateswara wanted to go on a visit to the Tirumala hills along with his newly wedded wife and seek the divine blessings of his favorite Lord. Accordingly he had kept all the travel plans scheduled much in advance and had also made guest house reservations for their comfortable stay on the Tirumala hills.. Although young Manohar is a successful Auditor so getting accommodation on the hills and seva tickets for the Kalyanotsavam was not a big deal for him for the amount of clientele he has in the aristocratic circles of Hyderabad. Even otherwise Manohar is a perfectionist to the core and would plan all the things on his own much in advance .. He firmly believes that everything in life whether big or small should be planned way ahead of time.He further believes and also quite arrogantly keeps telling all his fiends and colleagues that ‚ÄúThe journey of life should always go smooth and there should never be any inconvenience in life either to us or to those associated with us.. Life is not for the lazy or unplanned people but is only for the well prepared and successful people like me. Of course I believe in God but I believe more in my preparedness and my capabilities.. As long as am so well equipped in life there can never be any inconvenience to me or to my family.. And why should there be any when am so cautious in my approach towards life‚Äù Uffff.. How sick and boring some people can be.. Manohar is just a personification of arrogance.. However what the poor Manohar was not aware at that stupid moment of his life was ‚ÄúAbove all that is visible to the human eye today there‚Äôs One sitting there in an invisible mode and watching everything that His creation does on this planet.. It is not we who plan everything in our life but it is he Who does that for us much before placing us in our Mother‚Äôs womb‚Äù PERIOD Therefore Lord Venkateswara ‚Äì with an intention to teach Manohar a lesson for his arrogance and also to make him realize that there‚Äôs nothing that anyone in this world can really earn on their own unless it is there in the divine scheme of things ‚Äì had designed the following drama on the Tirumala hills using the most popular Indian Superstar yet the most humble devotee called Rajinikanth as a pivotal character in the drama. In a way through this incident ‚Äì that occurred on the Tirumala ghat road during the darkest hours of night ‚Äì Lord Venkateswara had proved to Manohar that he‚Äôs just a nobody in this gigantic universe. Please Continue Reading..Gateway To Tirumala Hills Near Alipiri Point After arriving at the Tirupati airport Manohar and his wife Archana headed straight to the Tirumala hills in a special Car arranged by one of his clients.. In the evening they went for the normal darsan of Lord Sri Venkateswara. Next morning the newly married couple attended the Kalyanotsavam.. Even during the sacred procedure of Kalyanam Manohar went about boring his wife telling her how hard he worked during his student days to achieve his dream of becoming an Auditor and how popular he‚Äôs currently among his clients and how smartly he gets their works done. What can any lady in Archana‚Äôs position during such embarrassing moments would say except faking a smile with a common thought every woman normally gets about men during such moments.. ‚ÄúMen are men‚Äù.. Archana was doing the same that moment of course still silently offering her prayers to the divine couple of Lord Venkateswara and Smt. Pdamavati to grant them that much desired eternal marital bliss in their life. After all it is with that desire that any couple would perform the Kalyanotsavam to the Lord in Tirumala Temple.. Right..??. After the Kalyanotsavam Both Manohar and Archna had one more round of darsan of Lord Venkateswara at the Garbha Griha of the Tirumala Temple. Later after having a sumptuous meal at one of the finest restaurants on the Tirumala hills they both went to their guest house and relaxed in the afternoon. In the evening both went for a walk on the pleasant Tirumala hills and went about buying a few gifts for their respective family members.. After that they had another round of lovely dinner at another luxurious restaurant on the hills.. After the dinner Manohar once again called the private Car owner whom he hired to take them straight to Chennai that night.. His plan was to go straight to Chennai from Tirupati and spend a couple of days there with his paternal aunt and then return to Hyderabad. During that telephonic conversation Manohar told the owner in a commanding tone ‚ÄúWe should at any cost leave from our guest house at 11.25 p.m to night.. Because the ghat road will be closed between 12 pm and 3 am.. So if we can start at 11.25 we can go down before 12.. From there we can reach Chennai by early morning.. If we cannot reach Chennai before that time then traffic begins on the roads and we will have to spend a lot of time in Car.. I don‚Äôt want that inconvenience at any cost.. So ask your driver to be at my guest house by sharp 11.15.. Is that clear Mr.Subrahmanyam..‚Äù The poor Subrahmanyam said ‚Äúyes‚Äù and disconnected the call.. Later Manohar and Archana returned to their room and relaxed for a while.. From 10 pm Manohar started hurrying up his wife to get ready.. When she said ‚Äù there‚Äôs time‚Äù he rudely replied to her saying ‚Äúwhat if we are ready half an hour in advance instead of being late by half an hour.. That‚Äôs the problem with all our Indians .. We don‚Äôt have time sense.. That‚Äôs why we are lagging behind in many matters.. See Americans.. How well they maintain their time. Hence they are way ahead of us and we are still in times of British.‚Äù Without uttering a word Archana not only got ready but also kept the entire luggage ready by 10.45 pm.. From there on Manohar started waiting for the driver and called him at least five times to make sure that he is reaching the guest house by 11.15 p.m. Finally the poor driver reached the guest house by 11.15 p.m.. Manohar asked the driver to first put their luggage in the boot area of the Car.. Later he sat in the Car and noted down the meter reading and then checked the functioning of the A C in the Car. After making sure that everything was perfect in the Car Manohar called his wife outside.. Then he stood along with her on the entrance steps of the guest house; turned towards the Tirumala Hills; and silently offered his prayers to Lord Venkateswara for a couple of minutes.. Later loudly telling his wife ‚ÄúPunar darsana praptirastu‚Äù Manohar boarded the car along with her and exactly at 11.25 p.m the Car left the guest house and headed towards the exit gate of the Tirumala hills. After a few minutes of silence in the car Manohar turned to his wife and said ‚ÄúThis is how I schedule any program in my life and this is how I mange my time table‚Ä¶ Time management is an art very few people in the world cultivate.. Fortunately your husband is one among them.. So sweetheart the summary is I want everything in life to be perfect including you‚Äù.. Archana just smiled.. Poor Manohar was not aware that moment that all his principles of life and about life are going for a toss in a few minutes and through one most horrifying experience Lord Venkateswara is going to teach him the harshest lesson of his life that will completely change his outlook towards life wife people profession and society.. PERIOD After A Few Minutes Of Silent JourneyThe great cosmic drama in the life of Manohar had begun.. And this was how it all began.. After crossing the exit gate the Car entered the Tirumala ghat road.. Later while taking a steep turn downwards on the darkness filled ghat road all the three in the Car first heard a loud blasting sound. Before they could even know what that sound was and where it came from the Car first started going down rapidly with multiple jerks and then started quickly rolling down uncontrollably.. The shocked driver just was unable to know what to do.. However he still composed himself and realized that something had seriously gone wrong with his Car.. Then slowly applying the brakes using the hand brake lever the sensible driver finally managed to bring the Car to a halting position. Manohar and Archana were in a frozen state.. Slowly regaining normalcy they stepped out of the Car and were shocked to notice that not only the rear wheel Tyre of their Car had blasted but also the Car went and almost knocked the wall that was built alongside the ghat road as a protection to prevent vehicles from slipping off accidentally into the valley. After remaining in a shocking silence for a couple of minutes assessing the whole situation Manohar slowly turned to the driver and said ‚ÄúLooks like the wheel went over a sharp stone and got busted.. It‚Äôs okay.. Such things happen.. Lord Venkateswara saved our Car from slipping off into the valley.. Now quickly remove the spare wheel and fix it to the Car. It‚Äôs a jungle area and is also very dark here.. It is also time for the wild animals to come out into open for roaming.. We will sit in the Car.. Finish off your job quickly and fix the spare wheel.. We should move from this jungle at the earliest‚Äù. Saying so Manohar turned back to enter into the car.. Freezing Manohar again the driver replied in a low tone‚Äù Sorry Sir.. There‚Äôs no spare wheel in the Car.. Gave it for a repair in the morning‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhattttt‚Ä¶???..‚Äù screamed Manohar.. Scratching his head the driver replied‚ÄùYes sir.. The spare wheel tube has a problem.. So I gave it in the repairing shop to replace it.. The shop is on our way in downtown Tirupati .. And it will be open round the clock.. Thought we can get it fixed on the way to Chennai once we are down the hills.. This problem I didn‚Äôt expect.. Sorry Sir‚Äù. Almost pouncing upon him Manohar shouted at him non stop for a full three minutes.. Unable to bear with the filthy language her well learned husband was using at that time while abusing that poor hapless driver Archana closed her ears. Finally the driver interrupted Manohar‚Äôs free flow of abusive language and said in a slightly angered tone ‚ÄúSir mind your language.. What can I do if tyre goes busted.. It is for Lord Venkateswara to protect His devotees.. You are in His kingdom so it is for Him now to protect you. How do I know what you did and why is He is punishing you like this‚Äù. Screaming furthermore loudly Manohar almost jumped on the driver.. Archana quickly came between the two and pulled Manohar back saying ‚ÄúControl yourself Manohar.. What can this poor fellow do if such unforeseen things happen.. As he said Lord Venkateswara gave this problem so it is for Him to provide the solution.. Let us sit in the Car and wait and see if any other vehicle comes down now‚Äù.. Still fretting and fuming Manohar told Archana‚ÄùThe ghat road is closed from 12 am to 3 am in the night.. It‚Äôs almost 1‚Äôo clock now.. So no vehicles will come now.. Until 3 we just have to sit in the car and wait.. In the meantime if no animal munches us we will survive otherwise Govindaa Gooovindaa‚Äù. Saying so Manohar went and sat in the car.. The driver then turned to Archana and said ‚ÄúAmmaa.. Listen to me.. There won‚Äôt be signals here so our mobiles will not be working.. Except waiting in the car until the ghat road is again open there‚Äôs nothing much that we can do now.. We can neither go up nor go down walking.. It is also too dangerous to do so as many wild animals like the wild Boars Wolves and Civet Cats will be freely roaming around this time.. Please sit in the Car.. Luckily if any emergency vehicle comes I shall stop it.. At least you both can go‚Äù. Left with nothing else to do Archana silently went and sat in the Car.. The driver just stood outside quietly watching the eight elements of Nature.. And Then.. Seconds started turning into minutes and minutes into an hour but there was no sign of any emergency vehicle coming from the upward direction.. The howling of the Wolves from a distance and the meowing of the Cats nearby combined with pitch darkness all around was making the night miserable for both Manohar and Archana.. Unable to bear with the fear of darkness and with the sounds of animals all around Manohar slowly started cursing Lord Venkateswara ‚ÄúWhat is this Swamy.. I have been your devotee since my childhood and came all the way with my newly married wife to seek your blessings and is this what you are doing to me now.. Not correct Swamy.. Not correct.. Not sure whether we will be survive this night or not.. And if we do I don‚Äôt know about my wife but I shall never come to your Tirumala Hills again Swamy.. Nevverrrr..‚Äù On the contrary Archana closed her eyes and was silently reciting ‚ÄúSri Venkateswara Vajra Kavacham‚Äù which she had learned in her childhood.. Time was moving slowly for them in that darkness; on that night; in that jungle; and on that sacred Tirumala Hills.. Exactly At About 2.33 A.MThe driver first saw the head lights of a Car coming from a distance form the upward direction.. Hurriedly getting up from the rock he was thus far sitting he quickly came on to the road to stop that Car. At the same time Manohar too heard the horn sound of that Car.. He immediately jumped out of the Car.. Looking at Manohar the Driver said‚ÄùSir looks like some TTD vehicle or a VIP is coming with a special permission.. I will stop the Car.. Be ready..‚Äù Saying so the driver went and stood in the middle of the ghat road and started signalling with a Namaskar pose to the speedily coming Car to stop.. The Car came zooming in but slowed down it‚Äôs speed on approaching the driver standing in the middle of the road.. The driver went running to the driver seat of that Car and explained him everything and requested him to drop them in Tirupati.. That driver turned his head back and told the same to his ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô sitting in the Car.. The ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô said something.. That driver then told this driver ‚ÄúBoss said ok.. We are any how going to Chennai.. They can directly come with us to Chennai.. Boss says ‚Äúnewly married couple should not have any problems..‚Äù.. Ask your customers to come and board the Car.. You bring the luggage and put it behind..‚Äù Mnaohar and Archana literally danced with joy..Thanking Lord Venkateswara they got down from the Car.. At the same time the ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô stepped out of his Car and quietly bending his head went and sat in the front seat of his Car beside his driver just to accommodate the newly married couple in the rear seat. Blaming the driver and refusing him to pay him his money for troubling them so much on that night Manohar quite thanklessly went and sat inside the Car.. The hapless driver could not say anything as the Car carrying Manohar and Archana left for Chennai.. Since it was too dark that night and as they were also so tensed up neither Manohar nor Archana could notice that great man who had come as a ‚Äúsavior‚Äù sent by holy Lord Venkateswara.. In a few minutes all the three of them slipped into a deep sleep. At About 6 A.M The Car carrying the ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô Manohar and Archana entered the city of Chennai.. After going a little distance into Chennai the ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô said some thing to the driver in Tamil and in a low tone.. The driver then told Manohar ‚ÄúSir.. If it is okay with you we shall first drop my ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô at his residence and then I shall drop you wherever you want me to drop.. That is what my ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô is saying.. Is that okay with you sir‚Äù. ‚Äú‚ÄùCertainly okay.. ‚Äù a fully beaming Manohar said.. Then turning his head towards the ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô who at that time was looking at the empty streets of his beloved Chennai city Manohar said ‚Äúthank you very much sir‚Äù. Without turning his head back the ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô silently raised his right hand and pointing it towards a Diamond studded small black colored statue of Lord Venkateswara that is there on the front side of his car said‚Äôthank him‚Äù. After about a few minutesSuperstar Rajinikanth The Car entered a luxurious house in Chennai city.. On halting the Car the driver quickly came running to the other side of the Car to open the door for his ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô.. The ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô majestically stepped out of the Car. Manohar and Archana too quickly stepped out of the Car to thank that gentleman who had so generously brought them to Chennai.. Firstly they saw an elderly salt and pepper bearded man with a bald head and with a Silk Shawl draped around the upper portion of his body.. It was a second later when ‚ÄòBoss‚Äô turned and came close to them that both Manohar and Archana felt jerks in their body as though affected by an electric shock.. It was a shock of their life for them.. The man whom they have grown up admiring ; the man who is the darling of millions of Indians living all over the world; the favorite star of all the Indian film stars; and the super star among all the Indian superstars ‚Äì the great Rajinikanth is standing like a smple man in front of them.. Manohar and Archana just couldn‚Äôt believe their eyes.. They quickly bent down and touched his feet.. Lifting them up the Thalaivar said ‚ÄúGod bless you my dears.. I came to Tirumala for a quick darsan and was coming back to attend a shooting in the morning in Chennai.. Met you on the way.. Am His devotee first and Rajinikanth next. Whatever you all think am today is entirely due to His blessings.. So I often go to His Tirumala Temple to offer my prayers and my sincere thanks to Him for making me what am today.. Otherwise who am I.. If He desires He can make a bus conductor a superstar and a superstar a bus conductor.. If you all think or if I think that I have earned this status with my own efforts then it is wrong.. Many people put many efforts in their life but how many people attain the status that only a few in India have so far attained.. Unless blessed by Him nothing moves in this world.. I don‚Äôt know who you are and what you do young man but do well in life.. But always be humble and be thankful to Him for all that you have so far achieved in life or you would be achieving in your future.. Be soft spoken.. Be kind to people.. Do all that you can do to your fellow beings.. While there are only a few people who are really earning well in this world there are millions who are starving.. So help them.. That makes God more happy because He is present more among them than in us.. Hands that serve are more powerful than the lips that pray.. I saw you shouting on that Driver and coming into my Car without paying him his money.. How is that poor fellow responsible for what had happened in your life.. By giving you this problem God is trying to convey something to you. Read the signals and read that message and change the way you are treating life now.. He gave you the problem but He had also given you the solution through me.. Right..??.. Otherwise why would my journey get delayed when I was supposed to leave Tirumala at 11.30 pm.. My Car too had a problem and it took time for it to get rectified.. May be He delayed my program because I have to come to your rescue.. Always look at life the way I explained you then all the happiness in this world is yours.. You must be having that driver‚Äôs number.. Call him immediately and make him happy by collecting his bank account details and credit the money to his account.. If possible send a thousand more.. It may not be a big amount to you but is certainly for him.. Good luck‚Äù. Then turning to Archana the great superstar Rajinikanth said ‚ÄúAmmaa.. Glad that I could be of some help to a newly married couple like you that too on the sacred Tirumala hills.. May you both have a wonderful married life.. Now promise me that you both will manufacture a Cricket team for me in future.. Hahahahaa‚Äù Love This article was written by Shri Nareenaditya komaragiri ji. All credit goes to him.

Recently one of my colleagues claimed that these 3 temples lie in a straight line. To find out I marked their longitudes in Google maps & Guess what ! Yes they lie in the same longitude. i.e Exactly 79deg 42 min EastSo what‚Äôs special about these 3 temples ? These are 3 out of the 5 temples that are clubbed together and called as Pancha boota Stalam ( Denoting 5 forms of Shiva - Fire Water Earth Air & Space )Sri Kalahastheeswara - Vayu Lingam - AirEkambareshwarar - Prithivi Lingam - EarthThillai Nataraja - Aagaya Lingam - SpaceOne more interesting observation Are there any other temples that lie in a same longitude ? Yes I found two of them.Virudhagireeshwar Temple VriddhachalamRamanathaswamy Temple RameswaramBoth are termed as the Punniya stalam ( Where they dip themselves in a waterbody to wash away their sins )How did the architects designed the straightness of these temple gopuras that are more than 1000 years old and 500‚Äì600 Kms away ? What technology did they have to mark the longitudes ? Did they have a mapping system ? Why didn‚Äôt the temples deviate from the alignment during any natural events like the tectonic plate shifting or the Tsunami ? What is the significance behind all this ? Nobody knows.. Edit 1 - Thank you all for the amazing response. This is just an interesting observation and an attempt to decode a pattern that existed for more than thousands of years ! This pattern may or may not hold any significance ( until we prove anything :-) ). To clarify on linearity I‚Äôm posting the co-ordinates here :Sri Kalahastheeswara Temple - 13¬∞44‚Ä≤58‚Ä≥N 79¬∞41‚Ä≤54‚Ä≥EEkambareshwarar Temple - 12¬∞50‚Ä≤51‚Ä≥N 79¬∞42‚Ä≤00‚Ä≥EThillai Nataraja Temple - 11¬∞23‚Ä≤58‚Ä≥N 79¬∞41‚Ä≤36‚Ä≥EP.S - Even if it is a coincidence it is worthy enough to notice right ? Edit 2 - Thanks again for the unexpected response ! To clarify a few more answers here is an addition. All the three deities (Lingams)were worshiped from around 600AD which was later enshrined in Temple structures by Chola kings ( Kulothunga Chola I II ) during 11th & 12th century. Also I continue to see people claiming coincidence. Even then it has to fall under third degree of coincidence.All are Shiva templesAll lie in same LongitudeAll are Panchaboota StalamI wouldn‚Äôt call it a coincidence. And here are the Missing Co-ordinates :Virudhagireeshwar Temple - 11.30¬∞N 79.20¬∞ERamanathaswamy Temple - 9.288106¬∞N 79.317282¬∞EKedarnath Temple - 30.7352¬∞ N 79.0669¬∞ EThank you Ashutosh Chaturvedi for the edit ! :) And the center point of undivided India was 21.149850¬∞N 79.080598¬∞E (Zero Mile); falls on the same line

Parvathi further says ‚Äú Swamy ( Lord) why is it that I'm being born again and again but you are never born again ‚Äú? Shiva says ‚Äú That is the secret of the immorality the secret of life and death dear. I can't tell you in this place let's go to a spot where there are no living beings and there I would reveal the secret to you. Saying this God Shiva Parvathi and His family started their journey to the Amarnath cave.On the way to the cave God Shiva left all his family members in the middle and reached with only Parvathi to the cave.The Place where Shiva left His mount Nandi came to be known as Pahalgam or Bailgam ( bail means bull in Hindi). This place is 100 kms away from Srinagar.From a distance of 16 kms from Bailgav Shiva renounced Moon at a place called Chandravad.After few miles Shiva left His ornament Vasuki the cobra king at a place called Sheshnaag ( this place is a combination of seven Hills present there) .Later Shiva gave up Lord Ganesh at a place called Mahaguna and later gave up the Holy River Ganga from His hair at a place called Panchatarini.Shiva kept His trishul outside at the entrance of the cave.After leaving them all Shiva and Parvathi entered into the Amarnath cave.After entering into the cave Shiva made a huge sound with His damru hearing to that sound all the birds present in the cave flew away.Then Shiva told the secret of life and death and immortality to goddess Parvathi. Shiva did not observe that in the corner of the cave two pigeon eggs were present and they hatched and two baby pigeons were born so this two pigeons heard the entire story.Shiva says ‚Äú Since these two pigeons have heard the secret they will be immortal and whoever sees this birds gets the highest virtue from today on wards we two will be in this pigeon form ‚Äú.Few people who went to the Amarnath cave reported to have seen the pigeons.Shiva manifested himself into the Ice linga in the cave to bless His devotees.It's a popular belief that Sage Kashyapa created many water streams ( rivers) in the mountains surrounding this cave.And it was sage Bhrigu who visited this cave first and made it popular to others.This temple is open only in the summers that too for a period of 45 days ( July and August month).When summer starts the ice starts to melt and the iced water forms into a Linga.It is said that during many foreign invasions people stopped visiting this temple from 12 th to 15th century.In 15 th Century one day a person named Bhuta malik went to graze his goats and yaks in the mountain. Then a Sadhu came and handed him a bag of coal pieces. But when Bhuta malik went home and opened the bag he saw full gold coins in place of coal. He was very happy and he went in search of that Sadhu to thank him in the process he finds this cave and again people started to worship the Iced Linga.Source :: Amarnath story in Hindu dharmam channel Shiva purana and devon ke dev mahadev hindi series.

His physical body is placed in the southwest corner on the fifth round within the Srirangam temple as ordered by Lord Ranganatha himself.Even many Srivaishnavas are not aware that in Srirangam their holiest place hailed as ‚Äò Bhuloka Vaikuntam‚Äò ( Heaven on Earth) lies preserved the body of Sri Ramanuja in all its pristine state unostentatiously without any fanfare or publicity and without using any of the chemical preservatives used for the Egyptian and Goan mummies. The egyptian mummies are kept in sleeping position and wrapped in cloth after applying several layers of chemicals. But Ramanujacharya original body is kept in normal sitting position and open to all for viewing. This is the only instance where an actual human body is kept inside a hindu temple for so many years. Ramanujacharya original body preserved in Srirangam Temple -In the year 1017 A.D. Ramanuja was born in the village of Perumbudur about twenty-five miles west of Madras. His father was Kesava Somayaji and his mother was Kantimathi a very pious and virtuous lady. Ramanuja‚Äôs Tamil name was Ilaya Perumal. Quite early in life Ramanuja lost his father. Then he came to Kancheepuram to persue his study of the Vedas under one Yadavaprakasha a teacher of Advaita philosophy. Ramanuja had re-installed Govindaraja idol in Tirupati which was initially thrown into sea by Kulotthunga Chola a Saivaite. He attained his Acharyan Thiruvadi (the lotus foot of his Acharya) in Lord Ranganatha temple at Srirangam and ever since Ramanujacharya original body was mummified and preserved there.

Tamil Nadu known as Land of Temples is a home to many ancient and beautiful temples. If you enter by any way into TN there will always be a temple to welcome you. Each village/city/town is built around a TEMPLE in Tamil Nadu and TN has no less number of facts and mysteries. Some of the mysterious cum scientific facts of such Temples are listed below.( the answer is little big) 1.Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple This famous temple of TN was nominated for the 7 wonders of the world with 33000 sculptures in this Templeits built in the angle of 23 and a half degrees coinciding with the axis of earth that means all temples are built without an angle with respect to rising and setting but this temple is built very straight to north and south Its still unknown how come the ancient kings built it so perfectly . one more mysterious fact is that no fishes live in the golden lotus pond of this Temple though the Goddess here is known as MEENAKSHI OR GODDESS WHO HAS EYES THAT OF FISHES still how much ever you leave a fish inside this pond it dies off soon. One more fact is this temple has the highest number of 14 Gopurams and no other temple in India as such number of very high and 14 Gopurams .2.Thiruvannamalai Arunachaleshwarar Temple. This beautiful ancient 25 acre Temple for Lord Shiva has a story that is as old as creation of universe. Normally Tamil Nadu follows Agama Shastras ( a combination of the Vedic Hinduism and Dravidian Hinduism) and in Agama temples there is a concept of Veedhi Ula( procession) wherein GOD made of Pancha Loham is taken outside once in a year or for a period of 10 days in a year and that time the god is taken out only by the main entrance way. But in this temple the GOD comes out by the adjacent way next to MAIN GOPURAM and its the only temple that follows this way and the reason is unknown.3. Thirukovillur Vishnu Temple Normally in all the temples of India Lord Vishnu have his CONCH OR SHANGU in his left hand and Chakra in his right hand but this temple is special. Here Vishnu have his conch in right hand and chakra in his left hand with his right feet raised above.4.Chidambaram Natarajar Temple. In India every God has his own temple and even if two main gods have a temple you should worship them in different sanctoms but in Chidambaram Temple you can worship GOVINDARAJA PERUMAL and LORD NATARAJA by standing at one point which is very rare and you can‚Äôt witness such type of Darshan in any other temple of world. In all the temples only the Uthsava Murthy comes out for procession but in this temple Moolavar or the main God(the God inside the sanctorium) comes on Veedhi ula( procession). This is the ONLY TEMPLE in India which celebrates both Thiruvadhirai festival for Lord Shiva( day on which universe was created) and Vaikunta ekadashi for Vishnu ( day on which the doors of Vaikuntam opens where according to beleif whoever dies on this day can get an oppurtunity of going to heaven irrespective of his karmas) 5.Thirunageshwaram Uppiliappan Temple This temple in Kumbakonamknown as the temple town of Tamil Nadu is very special temple for Hindus. The reason is due to the Prasadam given in this temple. Actually till now salt has never been added into any of the PRASADAMS done in this temple but still after pooja is done the naivedhyam offered to GOD tastes very good as if salt is added in it but the makers don‚Äôt add even a pinch of salt into it.6.Rameshwaram Ramanathaswamy Temple In the Shiva Temples of Tamil Nadu  the poojari gives Vibhoothi and in Vishnu Temples the poojari gives Theertham but in Rameshwaram this way is opposite. The shiva Temples of Ramehwaram give Theertham of Lord Vishnu and Vishnu Temples give Vibhoothi of Lord Shiva.7.Alwarpalli Natarajar Temple The murthy of ALWAR NATARAJAR TEMPLE is of a special one because Natarajar murthis are always made of PANCHALOHA ( a combination of 5 metals) but the murthy of this temple is made of stone and this stone is very special as it gives the sound of bronze metal when striked lightly.8.Ratnagiri Murugan TempleVellore A miraculous thing happens everyday in this Temple. Milk turns into curd after Abhishekam. Yes you heard it right. You yourself can witness this event of milk turning into curd after the Abhishekam in done.9.Kulithirai Manaparai Temple ( Ratnagiri Malai) This temple is present on an hillock . The mysterious thing that happens on this hill is absence of birds flying over it. Though you ca...

In addition one vault believed to house almost double the total discovered treasure hasn‚Äôt been opened yet or calculated into the total discovered treasures. Due to the spread of this news the temple has caught into imagination of every Indian and many foreigners something like Pyramids of Egypt or Inca Gold cities etc. Many think these gold treasures are exhibited for people to see and flock in large numbers only to be disappointed. However in reality the treasures are deep underneath in well secured vaults which are highly guarded while the temple functions like any other normal South Indian temple. For Malayalees its was much known the temple carries immense treasures though none expected to this level. As result it hasn‚Äôt caught any sudden fancy imaginations or fantasies for majority of Malayalees. However what should really fascinate anyone is the massive history and extremely huge legacy that this temple has in the history of Kerala as well as the revered position mythological and ritual wise.The temple is definitely part of 108 Divya Deshams (Holy abodes) of Lord Vishnu and its one of the most oldest surviving functional temples in the country. But for me the most interesting part is that this temple is part of a mythological representation of Kerala itself. As per myths of Kerala our state was formed when Lord Vishnu‚Äôs 6th Avatar- Parasurama threw axe from then-the tip of Indian subcontinent-Gokarna which resulted in rise of new land till Kanyakumari. As Kerala was created by Parasurama the land is also known as Bhargavakshetra (Abode of Bhargava another name of Parasurama). Its believed Kerala‚Äôs basic geographical shape itself is naturally designed in the exact way and posture as Lord Vishnu sleepsAccordingly the widespread belief as Lord Vishnu himself reclines throughout the length and breath of Kerala his head will be in Kasargod where the famous Ananthapura Lake Temple exist believed to be Moolasthanam (The Originating Place) of Lord Padmanabha his Navel will be in Thrissur where the famous Guruvayur temple exist and finally his feet at Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) where Sree Padmanabha temple exist. This myth is highly fascinating as it might be sheer coincidence that the state‚Äôs boundary lines today exactly resembles to the same way as Sree Padmanabha‚Äôs posture. For example one can see left leg of the lord is slightly raised to fold and you can see how Kerala‚Äôs Idukki district also slightly edges out a bit. Ofcourse Kerala state boundaries wasn‚Äôt drawn in 1956 looking at Padmanabha‚Äôs statue. But the sheer coincidence often cements the belief that Lord Vishnu reclines across Kerala and thus protects the land.Tamil Face- Malayalee Beauty Sree Padmanabha temple is a classic example of fusion of Kerala and Tamil architecture. From outside one may think the temple is typical Tamil Dravidian styled one as similar to scores of temple one sees in Tamil Nadu or Karnataka. Its primarily due to the towering Gopuram on the East GateThe East Gate or Nada as said in Malayalam is the most pictured image of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple as photography/videography isn‚Äôt allowed inside. Due to this almost everyone thinks the architecture of this temple is typical Dravidian unless one actually gets into. The moment one crosses the East Gate it automatically transforms into any typical Kerala temple with classical Kerala temple architectural elements like gabled roofs the multi tier brass lamp walls etc.The aerial view of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple gives the clear image of temple architecture which is heavily Kerala styled except for the East Gate. This can better understood if one looks the other gates of Sree Padmanabha templeThe West Gate popularly known as VIP gate as entries of VIPs and people with protocols are thro‚Äô this gateThe South GateThe North Gate normally regarded as exit gate. If we look all other 3 gates looks identical and typical in Kerala architecture. The East Gate that has Tamil Gopuram was the most recent addition built in 18th century during reign of H.H Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma Maharaja. Marthanda Varma wanted his favorite temple look massively grand and unique for which he commissioned architects to design a Towering Gopuram. The Gopuram actually represents the heights of Marthanda Varma‚Äôs victory in unifying his country from a loose Confederacy of feudal states (Venad) into a powerful centralized Kingdom (Travancore). The Gopuram in reality stands more as victory symbol of Travancore Kingdom which however remains as an odd man out for the rest of temple which is mostly in typical Kerala architecture. However inside the temple there is one Mandapam thats contributed by Madurai Nayaks. The Madurai Nayaks funded for a massive Mandapam which known as Kulakshera Mandapam featuring 28 balustrades of pillars. The pillars on the four corners can produce musical notes when tapped. The pillars are adorned with exquisitely carved figures in half and full relief. The Mandapam was heavily renovated during the time of Karthika Thirunal Maharaja after he gained the title of Kulashekaras from which this name of Mandapam comes in. The Mandapam along with circumambulation path (known as Sreevelipura) that carries 1001 motifs of Apsaras are the major Tamil elements that co-exist within the Kerala architecture.White beach sands of Temple Its a mysterious curiosity to see only within the temple one can notice white beach sands across the courtyard. Normally the soil in Trivandrum city are mostly laterite in nature and impossible to have beach sand only within the temple not anywhere else in the city. Many devotees claim they can hear the waves of sea while lying on these sands. Myths say its representing the shores of Milk Ocean were Lord Vishnu reside. Whatever be the truth the presence of white sands inside the temple is often regarded as a mystery.Two Mandapams and 3 door Sanctum Sanatorium The most striking or unique feature of this temple is presence of two Mandapams inside the Nalambalam (the inner courtyard of temple). Normally every Kerala temple has only one proper Mandapam (the Namaskara Mandapam) meant for Tantric rites. A huge Namasakara Mandapam exist for Sree Padmanabha temple too. But the unique feature the Sanctum Santorium (Sreekovil) further extends itself into another Mandapam which is known officially as Gajamukhamandapam (Elephant faced Mandapam) but more popularly known as Ottakkalmandapam (Single Stone Mandapam). The latter name has much more deeper meaning as this Mandapam and entire idol of Sree Padmanabha as well as the main Sreekovil are all built with one Single Slab of Granite. As this Mandapam and Idol are built over one single slab of granite essentially this Mandapam is considered to be a continuous part of idol. In olden days access to this Mandapam was severely limited though by early 20th century it was opened to all for better view of idol inside the Sanctum. All the major royal ceremonies are conducted over this Mandapam. This includes coronation of new King of Travancore as well as the Abhishekams of Sree Padmanabha. One key part is that no one is allowed to prostrate or touch their head on this mandapam. Its believed anyone who touches their head on this Mandapam becomes servant of the lord a right solely reserved for the Royal family. And every member of the Royal family have to prostrate fully in this mandapam to retain their traditional title- Sree Padmanabhadasa (for males) and Sree Padmanabhasevini (for females).What instantly brings attention of anyone is presence of 3 doors of the Sreekovil. The statue of Sree Padmanbha is nearly 16 feet in length and its impossible to have a double ply doors that have such a breath. Its due to this the sanctum has 3 doors that open to the large idol. The concept of Ananthashayanam features almost all gods in one place. Through the first door one can see Lord Padmanbha‚Äôs face the mighty Serpent- Anantha with his 5 hoods the right hand of Padmanbha which is in perpetual worship of Lord Shiva a Shiva Linga as there is his presence too. Through the second door one can see the Navel from which Lord Brahma the creator evolved. The Panchaloha Idols (the movable idols made out 5 sacred metals) of Lord Vishnu in all his regal attire along with Sreedevi and Bhoodevi (Goddess Lakshmi and Goddess Earth) can be seen from here. And thro‚Äô the final door one can see the feet. Essentially within this Sreekovil one can see the Supreme Trinity of Hindu Pantheon (Lord Brahma Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva).Presence of the Imperial Crown of CherasMost of Malayalees know the position of Sree Padmanabha. In 1750 AD Marthanda Varma Maharaja surrendered his Kingdom which he created after a strong annexation policy to the feet of Lord Padmanabha his tutelary deity. By this act which is called Tripadidanam in Malayalam (Surrender at the Holy feet) Sree Padmanabha became the titular Emperor of Travancore. The official name of the deity thus got into as Sree Anantha Padmanabha Perumal (where the Perumal represents the original title of Emperor as in Chera Empire era). The Royal family pledged themselves to remain as Servant of the Lord and acquired the title of Sree Padmanabha Dasa (servant of Sree Padmanabha) and ruled on his behalf. This wasn‚Äôt purely an act of devotion alone. Rather it reflects the brilliant strategy of Marthanda Varma. By consolidating the Kingdom Marthanda Varma earned enemies and all were ready to attack him back. By declaring Sree Padmanabha as the new Emperor no religious Hindu will ever think of declaring a war against Lord Vishnu himself. Moreover every institution in Travancore got renamed as Sree Padmanabha‚Äôs institution. Even today government employees working in Trivandrum refer their salary as Sree Padmanabhanite Pathu Chakram (Ten Chuckrams - Travancore currency as traditionally salary slips in those days were given in envelopes that carries royal emblem of the lord and title- The Reign of Sree Padmanabha). The impression that government was headed by Lord wasn‚Äôt a mere lip service as one sees in other Kingdoms. Rather Travancore King surrendered the famous Crown of Cheras to Sree Padmanabha and even today its well preserved in the temple and used by Sree Padmanabha during certain auspicious days. No Travancore Kings ever wore a crown at all nor sat on thrones as such.The Imperial Crown of Cheras called Cheramudi is inspired from hairlocks of Lord Shiva as Cheras were adherent worshipers of Lord Shiva of Vanchi (Thiruvanchikulam near Kodungallor the royal capital of Chera Empire). Venad Rulers who claimed the legacy of Cheras after the dissolution of latter got the right of the imperial crown and used during coronations ceremonies. Marthanda Varma was the last King to be ever crowned with this crown in early 18th century.Royal Coronation of Marthanda Varma with the crown which never happened anytime later in history of Kerala. The Crown has a huge meaning as its representation of Kerala‚Äôs past in total being the crown of only Empire the state had. With the crown on the head of Sree Padmanabha the deity still has the royal aura and thus often regarded as Nominal Emperor which is quite unique to the temple.Royal protocols As said before Sree Padmanabha still enjoys all privileges and ritualistic positions as an Emperor even in post Independent India. Some interesting royal protocols strictly maintained even today are;No Fly zone over the temple: Its indeed hard to believe but still a fact. The temple is strictly declared as No Fly zone and no aircrafts are allowed to fly over. The Trivandrum Airport and landing approach of all its flights are designed in such a manner that no flights actually fly over the temple despite of the fact the temple is hardly 2 km from the airport. All landing flights have to take a slightly longer circuitous route to land in the Southern side of runway. This is part of old custom that nothing must stand above the Emperor.101 Gun Salute: Sree Padmanabha enjoys a 101 Gun salute from Kerala Police even today. The temple has two festival periods-The Painkuni and Alpashi festivals. On the last of these two festivals Sree Padmanabha makes a procession around the city of Trivandrum. Prior to his exit from the temple compound Kerala Police makes an official 101 gun salute. As custom the City Police Commissioner of Trivandrum or an official of equivalent rank makes the first salute. The mounted division of Kerala police was originally called Sree Padmanabha‚Äôs Elite Mounted Guards (name changed to Kerala Police Mounted Battalion after Independence). This division‚Äôs primary duty is to be part of the famed Arattu Procession that take place on last day of these festival. Apart from Mounted guards one battalion of Armed Police takes part in the procession in reminiscent of old imperial customs. The King being the Primary Servant will take the Royal sword and walk in front along with other members of Royal family.The Titular King- H.H Sree Molam Thirunal Maharaja leading the Arattu Procession with the Imperial Sree Padmanabha‚Äôs Sword.The King along with Senior officials of Kerala Police State Police‚Äôs Armed Guards the Palace Guards and Members of Royal family marching ahead of Sree Padmanabha‚Äôs procession. The Main idols of Sree Padmanabha are in back.The Elite Mounted Police marching ahead of Procession.Grounding of Flights: Another tradition associated with Sree Padmanabha‚Äôs procession is that all flights in and out of Trivandrum will be suspended during the 2 hour gap when Sree Padmanabha is out in the city. The Procession enters thro‚Äô the Airport gate passes thro‚Äô the runway (as the airport came in the traditional route) and reaches the Shankhumugham Beach where the Arattu ceremonies are held. During this time all flights are grounded and no flights are allowed into. AAI issues a NOTAM in advance prohibiting any flights into the city during this gap. Its one unique custom probably in entire India thats followed here. As a tradition Indian Air Force which has its Southern HQ in Trivandrum also salutes the deity as it enters into the airport. Airport CISF Commandant also salutes on their behalf. These all are part of traditional customs as in olden days Sree Padmanabha was also the Supreme Head of Travancore Armed forces.The Arattu Procession inside the Trivandrum Airport over its runway with flights being grounded in the apron. When an airport shuts runway and halts flights for God! - Times of IndiaVellakali : Traditionally Nair soldiers of Travancore used to perform an artform called Velakkali which was for celebrating their victories in war. The Velakali in front of Sree Padmanabha temple is one of the most spectacular event that mixes the traditional valor with militaristic rhythms. Its something so unique and majestic that attracts huge numbers of people to witness the celebrations. Definitely its indeed a glimpse of past with the dancers dressed in old Nair soldier uniforms dancing to the rhythms especially the sheer number of performers who line up like a military formation.State Sponsored Niraputhari: Niraputhari is a traditional ritual followed across the state where the first set of paddy harvested were ritualistically presented to the local temple. Normally the Niraputhari traditions are hosted in second week of August when soon after the first day of harvest. However its normally done by citizens and devotees. However Sree Padmanabha enjoys a state sponsored Niraputhari when the Mayor of Trivandrum Corporation harvests the first set of paddy and carries to the temple. The first set of harvested paddy are normally brought by the Mayor along with officials from Ministry of Agriculture and cultural department which will be presented to the Maharaja who presents it to Sree Padmanabha.The tradition is so popular that even Communists who aren‚Äôt supposed to believe in temple matters do it regularly. The above video shows how former Trivandrum Mayor who was from CPIM- Mrs Chandrika performs the first harvest and took the first set of paddy on her head to the temple. Even current Mayor Prasanth who is also from CPIM tries his level best to maintain the quantum of harvest required for this rite at the temple. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/Niraputhari-to-be-handed-over-by-corporation-to-Sree-Padmanabhaswamy-temple-on-Sunday/articleshow/53571892.cms Navarathri Ceremonies: As like other state sponsored ceremonies for Sree Padmanabha Navarathri is also considered a major festival that involves state machinery into. The Imperial Sword of Sree Padmanabha is always kept at Padmanabhapuram Palace near Kanyakumari. Though the Palace is located in neighbouring Tamil Nadu state the ownership of Palace is vested with Kerala State Government and its a custom of the State to bring the sword to the temple along with the family Goddess of Travancore Royal family (Sree Vallomcode Bhagavathi) whose shrine is inside the Palace.Kerala Governor H.E Justice Sadashivam holding the Imperial sword of Padmanabha at Padmanabhapuram Palace As per tradition a senior Hindu Minister of Kerala Cabinet has to bring the sword.

The tradition is often considered a miniature of Mysore Dusshera where State machinery involved in similar processEDIT 1: The Imperial Treasury Currency Issue Sree Padmanabha temple had its own Imperial treasury outside the State Treasury of Travancore untill 1949. As a result it could mint its own coins solely meant for temple activities. The Highest valued currency of Travancore was called Pavan (ordinary Travancore currency was called Chakram and Ruva). The Pavan means Gold Sovereign (one Gold Coin of 8 Grams). This coin was solely minted for Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple by Temple Mint. Every cash donations made to the temple were converted into Pavan currency untill 1949. The Pavan coins were stored in the Temple Treasury only distributed to selected privileged ones. Those who got one Pavan coins considered it so sacred that its worshiped in their pooja rooms as the Pavan coins represent Lord Padmanabha himself. The currency has no numerals in it. Only written as Travancore Pavan in Malayalam in one side and the royal emblem with words- Sree Padmanabha written in Devanagari script.Another currency used is Thulabhara Coins which a set of gold coins used when the King weighs himself on the sacred scale (THULABHARAM). The gold coins equal to his weight then distributed to Brahmins as Dakshina. Its also minted by Temple treasury but not as sacred as Pavan.The value of these coins today exceed their metal worth nearly 10 times more. For example a sovereign of Thulabhara coin (8 grams of gold) costs nearly Rs 2 Lakh+ among Numismatists. Normal 8 Grams of Gold costs only 23K in markets. Pavan is almost impossible to buy today.These are some of the very unique features customs associated with this temple which pridefully has a huge place in Kerala history. Even our state emblem highlights the importance of Sree Padmanabha as we have adopted the royal emblem as our State emblem. The legacy and traditions make the temple most unique within Kerala which perhaps has more value than the entire fabled treasures.

It is located on a diversion from the Tiruchanur Road at a distance of about 31 km from Tirupati and 18 km from Renigunta. Among all the temples which surround Tirupati the least known Gudimallam is also one of the most fascinating. Gudimallam located just 30 km from the temple town is one of the most ancient Shiva temples in India. The lingam here is believed to the longest continuously worshipped lingam in the world and is said to be over 2200 years old.The temple is picturesquely located on the banks of the Swarnamukhi River and the deity here is unique a 1.35 M seven-sided monolithic lingam. The front plane has the figure of Parasurama standing on the crouching figure of a Yaksha. It rests on a base of seven concentric rings or peethams only two of which are visible above the surface. The lingam is believed to be a manifestation of the trinity‚ÄïBrahma at the bottom Vishnu in the middle and Shiva on top and the story behind it is just as interesting. Some of the copper coins obtained at Ujjain and belonging to the 3rd century BC contain figures which resemble the Linga of Gudimallam. A 1st-century sculpture in the Mathura Museum also contains a figure resembling the Gudimallam Shiva. It is said that Parasurama having killed his mother at the behest of his father wanted to atone for his sin. A sage advised him to perform penance on the banks of the Swarnamukhi River and he chose this sacred spot for the purpose. Each day a lone flower would bloom in the river which the sage would offer to the lord. Once Lord Brahma decided to test him and arrived in the form of a dwarf offering his help to which Parasurama agreed. The dwarf aided him with his prayers but tried to find a way to test the sage. At last he hit upon an idea and plucked and threw off the single flower in the river before the sage could use it for his prayers. For the first few days the sage thought that the flower had simply failed to bloom but then he suspected his aide lay in wait for him and caught him in the act of plucking the flower. His anger aroused he chased the dwarf brandishing the axe. Brahma realising that the joke had gone too far called out to Shiva who appeared and pacified Parasurama. He told him that his penance had borne fruit the minute Brahma had plucked the first flower from the river and that he need not carry his guilt any longer. Further he blessed them by merging them with the lingam Brahma crouching down as the dwarf and Vishnu as Parasurama on his shoulders holding his ax and a ram‚Äôs head. Such is the story of this unique temple! There is an atmosphere of spirituality that pervades this temple even in the absence of priests or devotees. After the crowd at Tirumala a visit to this temple can be an uplifting spiritual experience!

While two of these four arms are clearly visible to us the other two are at the back of the Deity in a held up and curled into fists position.. It is through these two empty back arms that Lord Sri Venkateswara is telling us that ‚ÄúAlthough my two back arms are now empty am still keeping them ready to use my weapons the moment I realize that there‚Äôs a threat to humanity in general and to my devotees in particular‚Äù.. It is also for this reason that we find His Discus ‚Äì The Sudarsana Chakra (beside the right posterior upper arm) and His Conch ‚Äì the Panchajanya (beside the left posterior upper arm) ‚Äì always kept ready for Him although only as decoration pieces just in case He decides to use them for whatever reason.. However what we actually see on the front side of the Moola Virat are the two anterior arms that the holy Lord Sri Venkateswara has quite unusually placed.. It is such an unusual placement in which the right anterior lower hand of the Holy Lord is bent at His elbow and is held in a supine position while His entire open palm is pointing towards His holy Lotus feet According to the Vedic scriptures such a peculiar hand position is called the Varada Hasta Mudra (The hand that offers boons).. With this mystic Mudra the Holy Lord Venkateswara is very emphatically telling us that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to stand here on the Tirumala Hills forever to protect my devotees in this unholy Kali Yuga.. For a devotee who has complete faith in my Holy feet am here to take care of him and his entire family during all the times they pass through the problems of this inhuman world‚Äù What is further more unusual here is that ‚ÄúLord Sri Venkateswara‚Äôs left anterior lower hand is straight down; bent at the wrist and is found lightly resting just below His left hip.. Such an unusual hand position according to the Vedic scriptures is known as the Katya Vilambita Hastha Mudra‚Äù Katya means panegyric or pay homage Vilambita means hanging Hastha means hand and Mudra means posture.. With such an unusual Hasta Mudra the holy Lord Sri Venkateswara is giving us great assurance by saying ‚ÄúAs long as my devotees have complete faith in Me I shall not allow the flood waters of this Bhava Sagara (Ocean of problems) go beyond their hip level‚Äù. ‚ÄúSri Venkatesa Charanam Saranam Prapathye‚Äù This beautiful article is written by Shri Nareenaditya komaragiri ji.

Lord Venkateswara gets all the flowers milk ghee butter from this village only.It is also said one can hear the sound of water waves from the back of the idolThough Lord Venkateshwara statue appears to be standing at the center but actually Swamy stands at the right side corner of the Garba Gudi.The oil lamps lighted in front of the Swamy idol are said to be lit since thousands of years.

In order to answer this question I need to give you a little background information. Some of you might know that holograms are produced using a monochromatic(single colour) beam that splits into two beams using a special lens. One of those beams is ‚Äòreference beam' and is radiated directly onto the holographic film. The second beam is reflected off of the object that you want to make a hologram of.When the two laser beams interest they create what's called an interface pattern. This is the pattern that the two sets of waves make when they overlap. That pattern is what recorded onto the film and then projected resulting in the formation of the hologram. The interesting thing about holograms is that if you cut that holographic film(the negative) into 4 pieces each piece will give the entire image. Even if you cut that four pieces into smaller pieces they will still give you the entire image. In short each fragment of that holographic film (that negative) contains the information of the whole. Moving forward let's look at this Purnam Shanti Mantra from Isha vasya punished:This means The supreme being (the Paramatma) is complete and self-reliant in the same manner we(the Atma) which is the fragment of Paramatma is also complete and has the same characters as those of the Paramatma.Our Atma is the replica of Paramatma.According to the ancient Hindu Samkhya school of philosophy the cosmos is holonomic i.e. the structure of the cosmos replicates it is self-similar at an ever decreasing scale and just like a hologram each fragment of this cosmos is complete in itself and contains all the information of the whole. (Now you might understand why I explained you the working principle of a hologram) Now the ancient Indian sages had led down the rules for art and architecture. In this they had said that all the manmade structures and objects must maintain harmony with the cosmos. By this philosophy the ancient Hindu temples are the symbolic representation of the model of the universe. A small part of the temple should be the replica self-similar to the whole. The ancient Hindu engineers were the master of geometry. Let me tell you what kind of geometry did they use to prepare the layout of the temple.In the above-sited image you see an equilateral triangle.In the second step join the midpoint of all the sides of this triangle and remove the central triangle.Repeat the same step.Again again repeat the same step and here we get a complex sophisticated design.Here every part of this image is a replica of the whole. The design evolves with each step we execute. This kind of pattern is known as the Sierspinki's Gasket. The geometry of such self replicated shapes is called fractal geometry. We find such patterns everywhere in nature; the clouds the coastlines river delta lightening licencing mountain ranges leaves cyclones Hurricanes and much more. Here're a few more beautiful examples of fractal geometry.   In the mid-60s when he was working with IBM's he used many computer softwares to create fractal patterns. Whereas in IndiaThe intricate design of each element of the temple structure was made using fractal geometry. Let me show you an example where it has been implemented 1000 years back.The majestic Kandariya Mahadeva temple in Khajuraho:The design of the shikhar of this temple has been created using fractal geometry.Here we have a main shikhar and then self-replicating smaller Shikhars surroundings these smaller shikars are even smaller self-similar shikhars. This is repeated at an ever decreasing scale. 2. One more beautiful example is Surya(Sun)temple. at Gujarat.Near the temple there is a kund(tank) to have a ritual bath. The stairs of this kund follow a pattern similar to the Sierpinski's Gasket.In fractal geometry while we're creating a fractal pattern we use the iteration process. Not only is the pattern being repeated in an ever decreasing manner but we're repeating the same procedure i.e. we're going into a loop an iteration. 3.)Here's one more great example 1000-year-old Ambarnath Shivalaya near Mumbai. Look It's not a simple square or rectangular layout. It's jagged.Here's another view of the same temple. You can easily make out the jagged edges. Now the rest of the world the western mathematicians or computer scientist dudes are creating these fractal images since last 50‚Äì60 years and it is only since last 15 to 20 years that they are implementing it in architecture. Whereas in India we've been doing this for the last 1700 years. This is the most interesting fact about the Hindu temples. :)

It is 74 metres in height and tilted at an incredible 9 degrees! The age of the temple is unknown and varying estimates put it between the 16th and 17thh centuries. There are a number of submerged temples around this temple. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is believed to have been built by a servant of raja mann singh for his mother. It seems like the structure was deliberately built on the banks of the Ganga river. No one is sure but the strange tilt of the temple may be due to the strong river currents and a possible weak foundation.

I recommend Yogyakarta especially Prambanan Temple. However before you come there first you must know the facts about Prambanan Temple below.(Source: Candi Prambanan) 1- Prambanan is the largest Hinduism temple in Indonesia and Southeast Asia which has a stunning architectural building.(Source: Candi Prambanan) Prambanan was built in the 9th century AD. Prambanan is also One of the UNESCO world heritage sites and the largest Hinduism temple in Southeast Asia. Prambanan is a building that was built in the 10th century during the reign of two kings Rakai Pikatan and Rakai Balitung. Towering 47 meters high (5 meters higher than Borobudur Temple) the establishment of this temple has fulfilled the wishes of its makers showing the glory of Hinduism in the land of Java. [1](Source: Candi Prambanan Jogja) 2- There is a legend that is always told by Javanese people about this temple the legend of "Roro Jonggrang".(Source: Kisah Rara Jonggrang dan Candi Prambanan) Once upon a time a man named Bandung Bondowoso loved Roro Jonggrang. Because she did not love Jonggrang asked Bondowoso to make a temple with 1000 statues overnight. The request was almost fulfilled before Jonggrang asked the villagers to pound rice and make a big fire to form an atmosphere like the morning. Bondowoso was able to make 999 statues with spirit power then curse Jonggrang into the 1000th statue because he felt cheated. Prambanan Temples are often referred to as Loro Jonggrang Temple. [2] 3- Prambanan Temple has 3 main temples on the main yard namely Vishnu Brahma and Shiva temples.(Source: Prambanan) Each main temple has one companion temple. For the Shiva temple accompanied by the Nandini temple for the Brahma temple accompanied by the Angsa temple and for the Wisni temple accompanied by the Garuda temple.[3] 4- The first report about Prambanan Temple written by C.A. Lons who visited Central Java in 1733. (Source: Bagaimana Candi Prambanan Dibangun?) In this report stated that Prambanan temple was collapse. Then restoration Prambanan Temple started in 1883 until 2002. [4] 5- There are 7 main statues spread in Prambanan temple.(Source: Prambanan) 7 main Statues are Siwa Durga Agastya Ganesha Brahma Vishnu and Nandhi.(Source: Prambanan) 6- Prambanan Temple Relief tells the story of Ramayana.(Source: Cerita Relief di Prambanan Yogyakarta) Along the inside of the wall is carved into the Ramayana relief. This Ramayana story is starting from the Vishnu scene that was asked to come down to earth by the kings to overcome the chaos that was done by Ravana. Along the inner wall of the ledge are decorated with a series of panels containing Krisnayana reliefs. Krisnayana is the story of Krishna's life since he was born until he succeeded in occupying the throne of Dwaraka Kingdom. [5] 7- The original name of Prambanan Temple is Siwagrha and the peak of Prambanan Temple like a crown. Siwagrha this name means Shiva House. Shiva is a God who is so special during the reign of Rakai Pikatan.(Source: Sosok Siwa pada Candi) As a form of respect Rakai Pikatan established a 3 meter tall Shiva Mahadewa statue located in the main room of Prambanan Temple.(Source: Candi Prambanan) If the peak of Prambanan Temple is observed it is a form of crown called Puncak Mastaka. This peak does not mean only a decoration but has its own meaning. This Mastaka Peak means lightning. [6] 8- Design Concept of Prambanan Temple resembles Semeru Mount (The peak of Semeru Mount named Mahameru)(Source: Gunung Semeru) According to ancient Hindu cosmology Prambanan Temple was designed to resemble the peak of Mahameru. This is because ancient people believed that mahameru was the home of the Gods. [7](Source: Gunung Semeru Puncakku Hilang Karena Cintamu) Finally I finished sharing some facts about Prambanan temple.

When these idols were being taken in a procession on a particular day strange unusual and alarming incidents took place. After these incidents these idols since 1330 A.D have not been used in procession.

Come to Kasargod the northernmost district of Kerala and visit Ananthapura Lake Temple [ https://www.realbharat.org/ananthapura-lake-temple-859/ ]. The facts will fascinate you.Ananthapura Lake Temple In a quiet village of Ananthapura in Kumbla town of Kasargod district amidst the panoramic background of extensive hillocks there is a beautiful rectangular lake of about 1200 square meters. Ananthapura Lake Temple was built in the middle of this lake. The temple vibrant with the divine presence of Anantha Padmanabha Swamy (Lord Vishnu) and located in the northern end of Kerala is believed to be the original abode (moolasthanam) of the deity of Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple of Thiruvananthapuram located in the extreme southern end of the state‚Ä¶‚Ä¶And the legends substantiate this belief. What the Legend Says‚Ä¶ The legend of the temple is associated with a great sage Vilvamangalam Swami who was an earnest devotee of Lord Vishnu. When the sage was doing pujas for Lord Vishnu in the holy spot of the temple Lord Krishna used to visit him disguised as a little boy with some mischievous pranks. The Swami used to enjoy the mischief of the boy and tolerate on most of the occasions. But one day when the naughty tricks of the boy became intolerable the Swami got annoyed and pushed the boy aside with his left hand. The boy fell in the lake and immediately disappeared into a cave. The sage then heard a divine voice: ‚ÄúIf you want to see me come to Ananthankadu (the forest of Serpent Anantha)‚Äù. Then only Vilvamangalam Swami realized that the child was none other than God himself. With deep regret he proceeded through the cave in search of the boy. Walking a long way towards the south he finally reached a wooded area which is the present Thiruvananthapuram. There he had a magnificent vision of Lord Vishnu in a reclining posture. It was at that holy spot the famous Padmanabha Swamy temple of Thiruvananthapuram was built.Cave of Ananthapura Lake Temple Still you can see a huge cave in the north-east corner of the Ananthapura Lake which is believed to be the cave where the little Krishna disappeared. People believe that the cave-way connects Ananthapura temple to Thiruvananthapuram temple. In front of the cave is a small pit with water which maintains a constant water level at all seasons and is considered as sacred theertham. A divine crocodile guards the entrance of the cave and the temple. Ananthapura Lake Temple and the Deities Ananthapura Lake Temple was believed to be built in the 9th century and from the ruins of the temples around the lake it can be concluded that it was a part of a large temple complex. Sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum) and the Namaskara Mandapam (space between Sreekovil and temple exterior) are located in the lake. Entrance to the Namaskara Mandapam is through a footbridge.

One case was reported where the HRCE officials were the thieves themselves.Over 41 case diaries of idol and jewel theft have gone missing. When temples are managed by greedy official instead of devotees they even destroy documents of theft as in the case of Kapaleeswarar temple. There are many more aching points like this the internet is filled with news articles reporting the same. I would like to briefly point out that temples are the soul of Indian culture. They were built with the aim of bringing about wellbeing in society and a lot of emotions as well as spiritual growth is attributed to temples. Unfortunately in many places in India temples are under the control of the government and particularly in the case of Tamil Nadu the powerful temples are being neglected & looted. Temples are consecrated spaces that have to be maintained in a particular way and with devotion else they end up getting desecrated. Governments have no business to control temples. Temples must be freed from government control and should be managed by devotees. In light of the same Sadhguru Founder of Isha Foundation has launched a #FreeTNTemples campaign where he strives to free the temples from the clutches of greedy bureaucrats and demands they be handed over to the devotees. It pains me to see this extremely sad state of affairs. I have pledged my support to this campaign you can also do the same.

Back in the 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs when thousands of hippies in the US and Europe flocked to the Hare Krishna movement and were chanting and dancing every day on the streets of all major cities the Hare Krishnas become an instant news sensation and were very prevalent in the media. Gradually all those young people got married and had to get jobs to support their new families. So in one sense they merged into the general society. However in spite of losing media prevalence they maintained their Krishna consciousness. Over the last 40 years the movement has now attracted millions of people all over the world who are of Indian origin to join its ranks. Thus the movement has become much bigger now all over the world than it was even in its days of media prevalence. Right now the Hare Krishna movement is poised for a new soon-to-come era of universal global prominence. As the global material society becomes more and more disintegrated breaking down into ever-increasing chaos as we are seeing it happening now there will soon come a time when the entire world will look to the Hare Krishna movement as the only solution for bringing true peace happiness and harmony to our troubled planet. At this time Krishna consciousness will become accepted all over the world as the new world religion and the whole world will be blessed with the greatest era of peace happiness and prosperity that the planet has known for thousands of years.

The mind goes in the wrong direction and has to be brought back. The senses want sense-gratification and have to be controlled. The mode of ignorance makes you lazy the mode of passion makes you attached and the mode of goodness makes you complacent. But one thing is clear from very early on there isn‚Äôt any other option. I could quit anytime but I would have to come back and carry on again from where I am now. Taking a break doesn‚Äôt make the problems go away. They stay right where they are until you deal with them. By humility and meekness one attracts the attention of Krsna. That is the verdict of all the Vedas. Therefore if one becomes very humble and meek he can easily attain the lotus feet of Krsna in this Age of Kali. So for the humble and meek it‚Äôs easy and for the rest of us we have to learn humility and meekness the hard way. But that‚Äôs okay because Krishna is the teacher and as long as we are learning Krishna is teaching and He‚Äôs a really spectacular teacher with a big bag of props and teaching aids. There is no telling what‚Äôs going to happen next and what the lesson is going to be but there‚Äôs always something new and when that lesson is learnt we are a wee bit closer to Him. And boy does He have a sense of humour and timing. My consolation is that qualified and capable people do things easily but when a person who‚Äôs less qualified and capable achieves something they have a little extra satisfaction from achieving something difficult. What route your path takes depends on you and Krishna. Some devotees stay their whole life in one place doing the same service and some travel constantly from temple to temple and country to country. Some have friends all across the globe and some know only a handful where they live. Some are celibate and some married. Some are wealthy and some are poor. Some are strict and some are lax. Some work with tribals and some with PhDs. Some live in a temple and some live at home. Some support themselves and some are supported by the temple. For some it‚Äôs easy and for others it‚Äôs hard. However it may be once you‚Äôve made a sincere commitment there‚Äôs no going back. Nothing else is the same and nothing is better. It literally is a journey out of darkness into light out of ignorance into knowledge and out of suffering into happiness. So many clich√©s I know but this where they originate from.

RelatedWhat is unique about the Hare Krishna religion?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-unique-about-the-Hare-Krishna-religion,,Pure Love of God unadulterated by material desires or anything material. That is the very special in the Hare Krishnas. Here is the sublime method that gives sublime results just Chant the Holy Name of God. Here is what Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who started the movement instructed: 1) Glory to the sri-krsna-sankirtana(chanting of the Holy Names) which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life of repeated birth and death. This sankirtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious. 2) O my Lord Your holy name alone can render all benediction to living beings and thus You have hundreds and millions of names like Krsna and Govinda. In these transcendental names You have invested all Your transcendental energies. There are not even hard and fast rules for chanting these names. O my Lord out of kindness You enable us to easily approach You by Your holy names but I am so unfortunate that I have no attraction for them. 3) One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly. 4) O almighty Lord I have no desire to accumulate wealth nor do I desire beautiful women nor do I want any number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotional service birth after birth. 5) O son of Maharaja Nanda (Krsna) I am Your eternal servitor yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet. 6) O my Lord when will my eyes be decorated with tears of love flowing constantly when I chant Your holy name? When will my voice choke up and when will the hairs of my body stand on end at the recitation of Your name? 7) O Govinda! Feeling Your separations I am considering a moment to be like twelve years or more. Tears are flowing from my eyes like torrents of rain and I am feeling all vacant in the world in Your absence. 8) I know no one but Krsna as my Lord and He shall remain so even if He handles me roughly by His embrace or makes me brokenhearted by not being present before me. He is completely free to do anything and everything for He is always my worshipful Lord unconditionally 9) If anyone recites or hears these eight verses of instruction by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu his ecstatic love and devotion for Krsna increase day by day.

The complete Maha mantra is as below: Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare This maha-mantra is already described in our various authoritative Vedic literature and is described as the only remedy to avoid the characteristics of this Kaliyug. This maha-mantra was given by Lord Krishna Himself in the incarnation of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who was Krishna Himself and descended on our planet some 550 years ago to deliver the fallen souls of this age by just chanting this maha-mantra. Lord Chaitanya‚Äôs avtaar is also described in our various authoritative shastras and puranas. Later on this maha-mantra was spread by the various Acharyas who came in the disciplic succession after Lord Chaitanya and finally it was A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (founder acharya of ISKCON) who following his Guru‚Äôs orders had spread this holy mantra in the entire world mercifully. Now in this maha-mantra: Hare: refers to the the internal potency of Lord Krishna i.e. Srimati Radha rani Krishna: means one who is all-attractive Rama: means one who is all pleasure Thus when devotees chant this maha-mantra they are actually addressing the Internal Potency of Lord Krishna - Srimati Radha Rani to engage the devotees in the service of the Supreme Lord Krishna. This is the only acceptable meaning that is given by Lord Chaitanya Himself and various authoritative acharyas who came in the disciplic succession after Him. No other meaning of this maha-mantra should be accepted and people who spread any other meaning of this maha-mantra are fraud and have no knowledge of Shastras or Puranas.

Vishnu > Siva > Durga / Brahman Thus the Hare Krishnas are strictly monotheistic and consider Vishnu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the origin of Lord Siva Goddess Durga and impersonal Brahman. They also see Lord Krishna popularly known as a form of Vishnu as the original form of God. Thus Krishna is considered as original supreme Personality of Godhead and devotion to him the ultimate purpose of human existence. This conclusion is derived from Vedic texts such as Srimad Bhagwatam and Bhagavad Gita.O conquerer of wealth [Arjuna] there is no Truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me as pearls are strung on a thread. [1] I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.

(5) To erect for the members and for society at large a holy place of transcendental pastimes dedicated to the personality of Krishna. (6) To bring the members closer together for the purpose of teaching a simpler and more natural way of life. (7) With a view towards achieving the aforementioned purposes to publish and distribute periodicals magazines books and other writings. These were the goals in 1966 and they are still the goals today. There are no other goals that are not connected with these so I guess that would make these the ultimate goals. If you want it in one sentence then: To get as many people as possible out of the material world and back to Krishna in as short a time as possible.

Radha and Krishna are one Radha embodies the internal and confidential Hladini Shakti. Hare Rama also refers to Krishna in his form as Sri Rama his Vishna-tattva expansion. Sita devi is an expansion of Laksmi who is an expansion of Radha; therefore she is internal potency Hladini Shakti and referred to as Hare also. Because refering to Radha and Sita as ‚Äúinternal potency‚Äù or ‚Äúenergy of the Lord‚Äù is somewhat impersonal she both is referred to as Hare. Radha is very chaste and as such hidden to outsiders so her name Radha is more confidential. In the vishnu sahasranam Krishna is referred to as Rama. It is also sometimes stated that Rama refers to Radharamana but this is a more obscure explanation. Rama can also refer to Balaram the first chaturvyuha expansion. Sanskrit is a Polysemic language meaning that one word or name can have many meanings and all can be correct. Sometimes the name ‚Äúhari‚Äù is confused with ‚Äúhare‚Äù but that interpretation is inaccurate as it refers to a male vishna-tattva incarnation and therefore an incorrect expansion of Krishna. Krishna expands himself as Mahavishnu (Karanodakasayi Vishnu the cause of all causes) who pierces the paravyoma (eight-fold covering of the universe) and resides within this material universe as Garbhodakasayi Vishnu (in the Garbhodaka Ocean). He then expands as Ksirodakasayi Vishnu and thus enters into the heart of every living entity as Paramatama or supersoul the God Particle within us all. Some claim Krishna is also a vishnu-tattva expansion of Garbhodakasayi Vishnu but this is an incorrect understanding even though it is stated in dasa avatara and is sometimes confused with correct Vaishnava theology which it is not. There is an order of precedence when it comes to incarnations. Krishna by the nature of his supreme prominence skips the whole chain of precedence bypasses Vishnu and goes straight to Mother Yashoda as is his prerogative. Everybody else has to follow procedure. Krishna is the adi purusha the original progenitor the cause of all causes. He causes Vishnu not the other way round. ‚ÄúGovindam adi purusham tam aham bhajami.‚Äù That is why in every Hare Krishna temple every morning that particular bhajan is played as the deities are greeted. First comes Krishna and all others follow. We should resist the temptation to assign Krishna different names or meanings or titles in terms of the mahamantra. There is no apparent need to complicate the mahamantra or assign allegories or hidden meanings. The mahamantra is about the love of Radha for Krishna and the love of Sita for Rama. When Radha and Krishna come together in the bowers of Vraja the entire universe is satisfied just as when Sita and Rama are reunited and returned to Ayodhya. Love redemption reconciliation reunion. This mantra cracks the hardest heart even mine. Bhakti is love.

In Kali-yuga also people worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by following various regulations of the revealed scriptures. Now kindly hear of this from me.‚Äù17 Detailed description of the Kali -yuga found in the most PurƒÅ·πáas sums up to the fact that in this age people are mostly sinful fallen and do not have the necessary qualification to study the original Vedas (≈õruti). But everyone has a right to study ƒÅgamas and vai·π£·πáava-tantras therefore such an important ingredient of the worship in the age of Kali Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mantra is mainly mentioned in such sm·πõti works. That being said we still find direct references to the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ-mantra in several ≈õruti texts. One of the most famous examples is the Kali-santara·πáa Upani·π£ad (literally ‚ÄúKnowledge how to cross over the Kali age‚Äù) which is the only Upani·π£ad that gives the entire Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ-mantra. This minor Upani·π£ad is very short ‚Äì its prose text usually divided into three paragraphs equals to 13 ≈õlokas approximately. It belongs to the K·πõ·π£·πáa-yajur-veda and is listed in the MuktikƒÅ-canon at number 103. Its summary is as follows: at the end of the DvƒÅpara-yuga the great sage NƒÅrada approached BrahmƒÅ the creator of the universe and asked him how one can overcome the evil effects of the imminent Kali-yuga. In reply to his question BrahmƒÅ said that one can do so by chanting the name of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa the primordial person. While asked again which exactly names should one chant BrahmƒÅ speaks to NƒÅrada the entire Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ-mantra: hare k·πõ·π£·πáa hare k·πõ·π£·πáa k·πõ·π£·πáa k·πõ·π£·πáa hare hare hare rƒÅma hare rƒÅma rƒÅma rƒÅma hare hare iti ·π£o·∏ça≈õaka·πÅ nƒÅmnƒÅ·πÅ kali-kalma·π£a-nƒÅ≈õana·πÅ nƒÅta·∏• parataropƒÅya·∏• sarva-vede·π£u d·πõ≈õyate18 ‚ÄúThese sixteen names counteract the evil effects of the Kali-yuga. After searching through all the Vedic literature one cannot find a method so sublime as the chanting of the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mantra.‚Äù In the current editions of Kali-santara·πáa Upani·π£ad however this mahƒÅ-mantra has a reversed reading with the ‚ÄúHare RƒÅma‚Äù part coming first. There has been a minor controversy regarding this which would be impossible to conclusively resolve here because to do so one must perform a hard task of collecting and collating all the available manuscripts of the upani·π£ad. Nevertheless we can at least mention several opinions regarding this. The most widely known explanation of this was expressed by K·πõ·π£·πáadƒÅsa BƒÅbƒÅjƒ´ (first half of the 20th century) in his book ‚Äú≈örƒ´ MahƒÅ-mantra-vyƒÅkhyƒÅ·π£·π≠akam‚Äù19. There he argues that since in Kali-yuga Vedic process of purification does not work and even brƒÅhma·πáas are like ≈õ≈´dras then not so many people are actually eligible to read ≈õrutis (to which Kali-santara·πáa Upani·π£ad belongs) and practice mantras given therein. At the same time PurƒÅ·πáas tantras and ƒÅgamas refer to the mahƒÅ-mantra as starting with ‚ÄúHare K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù Understanding this ≈örƒ´ Caitanya MahƒÅprabhu preached the latter version of the mahƒÅ-mantra from the ƒÅgamas thus giving everyone the benefit of its chanting and at the same time respecting the rules given in the ≈õrutis regarding the eligibility. We may never know for sure but since there is no mention of such reversion in any authoritative source and since we have plenty of evidence that mahƒÅ -mantra starts with ‚ÄúHare K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äù as we shall see below this explanation is not completely free from doubts. At any rate ≈örƒ´ Caitanya's inversion if proven or accepted would be enough at least for the Gau·∏çƒ´ya Vai·π£·πáavas to consider the mantra completely perfect with the ‚ÄúHare K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äù part first. Speaking about the order of the mahƒÅ-mantra in Kali-santara·πáa Upani·π£ad BhaktisiddhƒÅnta Sarasvatƒ´ said: ‚ÄúKali-santara·πáa Upani·π£ad has been published in Mumbai and Madras but because [the manuscripts of] the upani·π£ad were collected from the adulterated members of the RƒÅmƒÅyet-sampradƒÅya the order of the mahƒÅ-mantra in these particular editions was reversed. But even despite being so its meaning and position cannot be reversed. Any wise person will not accept any order or reading different from the mahƒÅ-mantra and its order given by the person denoted by the holy name (nƒÅmi) ≈örƒ´ Gaurasundara who himself descended in Kali-yuga to distribute the easy process for crossing over the age of Kali (kali-santara·πáa) and attaining love of God.‚Äù20 The ancient text of the Ananta- sa·πÅhitƒÅ clearly corroborates the ≈õruti evidence found in the Kali-santara·πáa Upani·π£ad but more it corroborates that the mahƒÅ-mantra begins with the ‚ÄúHare K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äù part of the mantra: hare k·πõ·π£·πáa hare k·πõ·π£·πáa k·πõ·π£·πáa k·πõ·π£·πáa hare hare hare rƒÅma hare rƒÅma rƒÅma rƒÅma hare hare ·π£o·∏ça≈õaitƒÅni nƒÅmƒÅni dvƒÅtri·πÅ≈õad var·πáakƒÅni hi kalau yuge mahƒÅ-mantra·∏• sammato jƒ´vatƒÅra·πáe tƒÅraka·πÅ brahma-nƒÅmaitad brahma·πáƒÅ guru·πáƒÅdinƒÅ kali-santara·πáƒÅdyƒÅsu ≈õruti·π£v-adhigata·πÅ hare·∏• prƒÅpta·πÅ ≈õrƒ´ brahma-≈õi·π£ye·πáa ≈õrƒ´ nƒÅradena dhƒ´matƒÅ nƒÅmaitad-uttama·πÅ ≈õrauta-pƒÅramparye·πáa brahma·πáa·∏•21 ‚ÄúAll ≈õƒÅstras agree that the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ-mantra which is composed of sixteen names divided into thirty-two syllables is the great mantra for delivering the jƒ´vas in Kali-yuga. The original guru Lord BrahmƒÅ received these holy names which which deliver one from material existence from Lord Hari as described in the Kali-santara·πáa Upani·π£ad and other ≈õrutis. The intelligent sage NƒÅrada the disciple of Lord BrahmƒÅ received these highest names by the process of hearing from a spiritual authority.‚Äù Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ-mantra‚Äôs correct order is also defined in Sanat-kumƒÅra-sa·πÅhitƒÅ: hare k·πõ·π£·πáau dvir ƒÅv·πõttau k·πõ·π£·πáa tƒÅd·πõk tathƒÅ hare hare rƒÅma tathƒÅ rƒÅma tathƒÅ tƒÅd·πõk hare puna·∏• hare k·πõ·π£·πáa hare k·πõ·π£·πáa k·πõ·π£·πáa k·πõ·π£·πáa hare hare hare rƒÅma hare rƒÅma rƒÅma rƒÅma hare hare22 ‚ÄúThe words ‚ÄòHare K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äô are to be repeated twice then ‚ÄòK·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äô and ‚ÄòHare‚Äô are to be repeated separately twice. Similarly ‚ÄòHare RƒÅma‚Äô ‚ÄòRƒÅma‚Äô and ‚ÄòHare‚Äô are also repeated twice. The mantra will thus be ‚Äì Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa Hare Hare Hare RƒÅma Hare RƒÅma RƒÅma RƒÅma Hare Hare. (Sanat-kumƒÅra-sa·πÅhitƒÅ as quoted by DhyƒÅnacandra GosvƒÅmƒ´ in his Gaura-GovindƒÅrcana-smara·πáa-paddhati verses 132-133). In practice however the question of order is not of primary importance since as soon as one starts chanting the mantra such differences disappear in the incessant flow of the names. This is confirmed by A.C. BhaktivedƒÅnta Swami PrabhupƒÅda: ‚ÄúEither you chant Hare RƒÅma or you chant Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa it is the same. There is no difference. Sometimes they first of all place "Hare RƒÅma Hare RƒÅma RƒÅma RƒÅma Hare Hare." And sometimes they place "Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa..." There is no difference. Sometimes they say "No it should be Hare RƒÅma first." Sometimes they ... "No Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa." But that is not very important childish. Any... either you say Hare RƒÅma or Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa the same. So this is to be done.‚Äù23 Another ≈õruti Caitanyopani·π£ad from the Atharva-veda which was published by KedƒÅranƒÅtha Datta (Bhaktivinoda ·π¨hƒÅkura) in 1887 also refers to the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ -mantra. What appears to have been a single manuscript of this Upani·π£ad was sent to KedƒÅranƒÅtha by a devotee named Madhus≈´dana DƒÅsa from Sambalpur Odisha24. Therein BrahmƒÅ tells PippalƒÅda about the upcoming advent of the Supreme Lord as ≈örƒ´ Caitanya who will chant the confidential mantra of his own names: sa eva m≈´la-mantra·πÅ japati harir iti k·πõ·π£·πáa iti rƒÅma iti ‚ÄúHe chants a m≈´la-mantra consisting of the names Hari K·πõ·π£·πáa and RƒÅma.‚Äù (Caitanyopani·π£ad 11)25. Here BrahmƒÅ clearly alludes to the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ -mantra by mentioning three names constituting it in the nominative case. And in the following verse he again alludes to it by stating the number of names in it: nƒÅmƒÅny a·π£·π≠ƒÅv a·π£·π≠a ca ≈õobhanƒÅni tƒÅni nitya·πÅ ye japanti dhƒ´rƒÅs te vai mƒÅyƒÅm atitaranti nƒÅnya·∏• parama·πÅ mantra·πÅ parama-rahasya·πÅ nityam ƒÅvartayati. ‚ÄúThese two parts of eight names each are very glorious. Those wise persons who always chant them surely cross beyond the illusion of material existence. Others do not. The liberated persons always chant this supreme mantra which is very confidential.‚Äù (Caitanyopani·π£ad 14)26. References to the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ-mantra from a number of PurƒÅ·πáas are quoted in the post-Caitanya works. Unfortunately not all of them can be traced to the current editions of these PurƒÅ·πáas. For example DhyƒÅnacandra GosvƒÅmƒ´ in his paddhati (manual for mediation and worship) quotes Padma-PurƒÅ·πáa: dvƒÅtri·πÅ≈õad ak·π£ara·πÅ mantra·πÅ nƒÅma ·π£o·∏ça≈õakƒÅnvitam prajapan vai·π£·πáavo nitya·πÅ rƒÅdhƒÅ-k·πõ·π£·πáa-sthala·πÅ labhet ‚ÄúA vai·π£·πáava who constantly chants the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa mahƒÅ-mantra composed of sixteen names divided into thirty-two syllables will certainly attain the abode of RƒÅdhƒÅ-K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù (≈örƒ´ ≈örƒ´ RƒÅdhƒÅ-K·πõ·π£·πáƒÅ·π£·π≠a-kƒÅlƒ´ya-lƒ´lƒÅ-smara·πáa-krƒÅma-paddhati·∏• 161)27. NayanƒÅnanda ·π¨hƒÅkura quotes BrahmƒÅ·πá·∏ça PurƒÅ·πáa in his K·πõ·π£·πáa-bhakti-rasa-kadamba (A.D. 1730): hare k·πõ·π£·πáa hare k·πõ·π£·πáa k·πõ·π£·πáa k·πõ·π£·πáa hare hare iti japtvƒÅ pramucyeta pƒÅtakƒÅ nƒÅtra sa·πÅ≈õaya·∏• ‚ÄúHare K·πõ·π£·πáa Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa Hare Hare." ‚ÄúAny sinful person who chants these holy names is at once liberated.

In the 6th chapter there is a conversation between king V·πõsabhƒÅnu and Kratu Muni. The king after performing severe penances for many years hears a celestial voice (vƒÅk a≈õƒÅrƒ´ri·πáƒ´) that instructs him to take to the chanting of Hari's names. When he asks which names exactly should he chant the demigoddess sends him to a sage named Kratu who lives nearby deeply immersed in meditation. The king approaches the sage and asks him for harinƒÅma. The sage gives him harinƒÅma-mantra and at this moment Lomahar·π£a·πáa S≈´ta interrupts VedavyƒÅsa's narration and requests him to repeat the mantra given by Kratu to V·πõsabhƒÅnu: yat tvayƒÅ kƒ´rtita·πÅ nƒÅtha hari-nƒÅmeti sa·πÅj√±itam mantra·πÅ brahma-pada·πÅ siddhi-kara·πÅ tad vada no vibho ‚ÄúO powerful sage!

It was recently formed as an official organization and brought to the rest of the world outside of India by a saint named A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada.Their beliefs are as follows: We all have an eternal relationship with our original divine source known in various religious and spiritual traditions by many names some call Him God some call Him Allah and the Hare Krishnas call Him Krishna. We ourselves are a part of Krishna but at the same time we have our own separate individuality as well. We are one with Him in quality in that we are both spiritual yet we are different from Him in terms of quantity. It‚Äôs just like a drop of water from the ocean. The drop of water from the ocean is one with the ocean in that it is of the same quality yet it is different from the ocean in terms of quantity. We can revive this relationship with Krishna through the process of bhakti-yoga or devotion. By becoming devoted to Krishna and doing various spiritual practices (the foremost of which is hearing and chanting God‚Äôs name - in whatever religion whatever is accustomed to) one gradually revives this relationship more and more until one reaches the stage of spiritual perfection. At the stage of spiritual perfection one experiences the intense ecstasy of love of God. One no longer has any material defects (such as lust anger greed illusion pride and envy). When one achieves this stage one has the choice of going to the spiritual realm where he or she can enjoy an eternal life of bliss participating in the adventurous and fun activities of Krishna and His devotees. If one achieves this stage in this life which one can then one experiences this spiritual world even in his current body (he experiences it internally within himself so such a person can act in this world yet still be experiencing this) and after he or she dies then he or she can go to the spiritual realm. I should also note that Krishna is not an impersonal force - but also a person. There are other spiritual paths that advocate for a type of spiritual suicide where one extinguishes one‚Äôs identity and merges in the light emanating from God. But Hare Krishna would advocate that experiencing God‚Äôs personal form is far more blissful. Imagine if you were to lock yourself in a room for all of eternity. Yes you probably wouldn‚Äôt suffer much - but you also wouldn‚Äôt be very happy. So when one commits spiritual suicide and merges into the light of God then yes one doesn‚Äôt suffer - but one also doesn‚Äôt experience joy just like how someone in a room doesn‚Äôt suffer yet at the same time doesn‚Äôt experience much happiness either. However by being with Krishna in His world one gets to retain his or her individuality becomes freed from all kinds of material sufferings and instead gets to enjoy a blissful life of constant exciting adventures with God. They are called the Hare Krishnas because they chant the names of God through the maha-mantra which goes: Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.Here‚Äôs a video that explains mantra meditation more in-depth:Hopefully this answered your question.

While the Hare Krishna philosophy is very deep because it represents the ancient tradition of Gaudiya Vaishnavism the philosophy can be summarized as follows.We have an eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is known in various spiritual and religious traditions as Krishna God Allah Jehovah etc. We are eternal spiritual souls and the nature of our relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is that we are parts of Him. However we are not equal to Him in quantity or greatness though we are equal to Him in quality. For instance a drop of water from the ocean is equal to the ocean in its quality though it‚Äôs different in terms of the quantity. Also just as we are persons God too is a person. By reviving our original relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or Krishna then we can enjoy an intimate loving relationship with Him in the spiritual world.To revive this relationship we take to the process of devotional service. Devotional service means to act think and speak for the pleasure of Krishna. One of the primary practices of devotional service is to hear and chant the names of God. This is most commonly done for Hare Krishnas through the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra: Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. While Hare Krishnas prefer to chant this mantra they also believe that one can chant the names of God given in one‚Äôs own religious or spiritual tradition. Aside from hearing and chanting God‚Äôs names there are also other practices one can do. One can visit a holy place or a place of worship like a temple mosque or church serve other devotees of the Lord eat food which has been spiritualized by having first been offered to Krishna share the knowledge of Krishna consciousness with others read spiritual literature and more. There is a comprehensive book on the science of devotional service called the Nectar of Devotion which you can consult if you want to read more. One‚Äôs job can also be an act of devotional service if one does it with the intention of pleasing the Lord.After practicing devotional service we can reach the stage of spiritual perfection or pure love of God. At this stage all the impurities in our heart such as lust anger greed illusion pride and envy are completely eradicated. Instead one‚Äôs heart is filled with love for Krishna which drowns the devotee in a continuous feeling of intense bliss and ecstasy. By reaching this stage one no longer has to take birth in the material world. However one can reach this stage even while in the material world. When this happens the devotee can be engaged in working within the world; however internally the devotee experiences an inner spiritual life. It is this pure love of God which will completely satisfy us other forms of happiness are only temporary and will thus only offer us temporary satisfaction.Of course this is only a nutshell of what Hare Krishnas believe. There are more details and other practical pieces of wisdom found with the various scriptures of Hare Krishna. If you want to read more of them you can visit Bhaktivedanta Vedabase Online.
